<h4 id="text-books">Text Books</h4>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces</a></li>
  <li>Linux System Programming: Talking Directly to the Kernel and C Library by Robert Love</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some great resources mentioned in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/7sdcaq/best_way_to_learn_os_concepts_properly_so_that_i/">reddit thread</a>, i’ll be exploring them as i progress</p>

<p><strong>Update 13/05/2024</strong></p>

<p>I have gone through the first section of OSTEP text book i.e., Virtualization. My goals before starting the next section (Concurrency):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setup xv6 OS in QEMU.</li>
  <li>Understand the topics of virtualization practically by reading and tweaking xv6 codebase.</li>
  <li>Read all the relevant references and complete homework sections of few chapters.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update 30/05/2024</strong></p>

<p>I am going through some basic chapters of x86 and ARM Assembly to get better understanding of low level topics like system calls, interrupts, stack memory, etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Components of CPU</li>
  <li>64 bit and 32 bit computer differences</li>
  <li>System calls and interrupts</li>
</ol>]]></content><author><name>Sanketh</name></author><category term="operating-systems" /><category term="learning-resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have previously studied operating systems as a part of my university curriculum, i’ve realized it’s time to revisit the fundamentals and go beyond.
