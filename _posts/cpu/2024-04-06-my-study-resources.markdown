I have previously studied operating systems as a part of my university curriculum, i've realized it's time to revisit the fundamentals and go beyond. I have decided to start with some popular books. I will add more resources as i go along.

#### Text Books

1. [Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
2. Linux System Programming: Talking Directly to the Kernel and C Library by Robert Love
3. [Computer Architecture A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson](https://acs.pub.ro/~cpop/SMPA/Computer%20Architecture%20A%20Quantitative%20Approach%20(5th%20edition).pdf)

#### Links

1. [Overview of MIPS Assembly](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~adi-yoga/CS2100/ch07/)

There are some great resources mentioned in this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/7sdcaq/best_way_to_learn_os_concepts_properly_so_that_i/), i'll be exploring them as i progress

#### Playlists

1. [Computer Architecture Playlists by Prof. Dr. Ben H. Juurlink](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeWkeA7esB-MuCn8XQWAarM7zvimE0yme)
