I have previously studied operating systems as a part of my university curriculum, i've realized it's time to revisit the fundamentals and go beyond. I have decided to start with some popular books. I will add more resources as i go along.

#### Text Books

1. [Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
2. Linux System Programming: Talking Directly to the Kernel and C Library by Robert Love

There are some great resources mentioned in this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/7sdcaq/best_way_to_learn_os_concepts_properly_so_that_i/), i'll be exploring them as i progress

I have gone through the first section of OSTEP text book i.e., Virtualization. My goals before starting the next section (Concurrency):

* Setup xv6 OS in QEMU.
* Understand the topics of virtualization practically by reading and tweaking xv6 codebase. 
* Read all the relevant references and complete homework sections of few chapters. 

**Update 30/05/2024**

I am going through some basic chapters of x86 and ARM Assembly to get better understanding of low level topics like system calls, interrupts, stack memory, etc. 

1. Components of CPU
2. 64 bit and 32 bit computer differences
3. System calls and interrupts
