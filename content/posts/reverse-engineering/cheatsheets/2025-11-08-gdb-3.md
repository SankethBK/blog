## Examining Memory with `x` Command

The `x` (examine) command is more powerful for raw memory:

```gdb
x/[count][format][size] address
```

### Size Modifiers
- `b` = byte (1 byte)
- `h` = halfword (2 bytes)
- `w` = word (4 bytes)
- `g` = giant word (8 bytes)

### Format Modifiers
- `x` = hexadecimal
- `d` = decimal
- `u` = unsigned decimal
- `o` = octal
- `t` = binary
- `c` = character
- `s` = string
- `i` = instruction (disassembly)

**count**: how many units to display

### Examples

#### View bytes in hex
```gdb
x/8xb &buffer_one        # 8 bytes in hex
x/16xb buffer_two        # 16 bytes in hex
```

#### View as words (4 bytes)
```gdb
x/4xw &value             # 4 words (16 bytes) in hex
x/8xw $rsp               # Examine stack
```

#### View as characters
```gdb
x/8c buffer_one          # 8 characters
x/20c argv[1]            # 20 characters from argument
```

#### View as string
```gdb
x/s buffer_one           # Show as null-terminated string
x/s 0x555555556004       # String at specific address
```

#### View as instructions
```gdb
x/10i main               # Disassemble 10 instructions
x/5i $pc                 # Show next 5 instructions
```

#### Combined format (hex + ASCII)
```gdb
x/32xb buffer_two        # Hex bytes
x/32c buffer_two         # Same area as characters
```
