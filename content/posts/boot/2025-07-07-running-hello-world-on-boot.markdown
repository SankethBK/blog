## BIOS Boot Recap

Previously, we saw that after the BIOS firmware is loaded, it searches for a bootable device from a list of storage options, such as a hard drive, SSD, USB, or network interface. The BIOS identifies a valid bootable device by checking for the `0x55AA` signature at the end of the first sector. Once found, it loads the 512 bytes from this sector (LBA 0), which is known as the Master Boot Record (MBR).

**MBR Structure Breakdown:**

- **Bytes 0-445 (446 bytes):** The boot code, often called the "bootstrap" code. This is the small program that the BIOS executes.
- **Bytes 446-509 (64 bytes):** The partition table, which contains four 16-byte entries, each describing a primary partition.
- **Bytes 510-511 (2 bytes):** The boot signature (`0x55AA`), which validates the sector as bootable.

## What is this 446-byte code supposed to do?

### 1. Hardware Initialization:

The code initializes basic hardware components and sets up the processor to operate in a known state.

The hardware initialization performed by MBR code is quite limited but crucial for establishing a stable foundation for the boot process. Let me detail what actually happens:

#### Processor State Setup:

##### Register Initialization:
- Sets up segment registers (CS, DS, ES, SS) to known values
- Initializes the stack pointer (SP) to create a small working stack
- Clears or sets specific CPU flags to ensure predictable behavior
- The BIOS typically loads MBR at physical address 0x7C00, so CS:IP points there

##### Interrupt Handling:

- May disable interrupts temporarily during critical operations
- Sets up or modifies interrupt vectors for basic hardware services
- Ensures the processor can handle hardware interrupts predictably

##### Memory Setup:

##### Stack Configuration:

- Establishes a small stack space (usually just a few hundred bytes)
- Sets SS (Stack Segment) and SP (Stack Pointer) registers
- This is essential since the code needs stack space for function calls and local variables

##### Memory Map Awareness:

- The code must work within the known memory layout established by BIOS
- Avoids overwriting critical BIOS data areas
- Understands where it can safely use memory for temporary storage

### 2. Partition Table Reading:

It reads and interprets the partition table (located in the remaining 66 bytes of the 512-byte MBR) to identify which partition is marked as active/bootable.

### 3. Active Partition Location:

The code searches through the four partition table entries to find the one marked with the boot flag (0x80), indicating it's the active partition.

### 4. Loading the Volume Boot Record:

Once the active partition is identified, the boot loader loads the first sector of that partition (called the Volume Boot Record or VBR) into memory.

### 5. Transfer Control:

After loading the VBR, the MBR code transfers execution control to the VBR, which then continues the boot process by loading the operating system.

### 6. Error Handling:

The code includes basic error handling to display messages like "Invalid partition table" or "Missing operating system" if problems are encountered.

## Processor States

It operates in 16-bit real mode with very limited memory and no operating system services. The code is typically written in assembly language and must be extremely efficient.

### What is Real Mode?

Real mode is the default operating mode that x86 processors (starting with the 8086) boot into. It's called "real" because memory addresses correspond directly to actual physical memory locations - there's no virtual memory or memory protection.

### Key Characteristics of 16-bit Real Mode:

#### Memory Addressing:

- Uses 16-bit registers but can access up to 1MB of memory (20-bit addressing)
- Memory is accessed using a segmented model with segment:offset pairs
- Example: address 0x1000:0x0500 means segment 0x1000 shifted left 4 bits + offset 0x0500. This gives physical address: (0x1000 << 4) + 0x0500 = 0x10500

#### Register Size:

- All general-purpose registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, etc.) are 16 bits wide
- You can access 8-bit portions (AH/AL for register AX)
- No 32-bit extended registers available

#### Memory Limitations:

- Maximum addressable memory: 1MB (actually 1MB + 64KB - 16 bytes due to segment wraparound)
- No memory protection - any code can access any memory location
- No virtual memory management

#### Instruction Set:

- Limited to 8086/8088 instruction set
- No protected mode instructions
- No floating-point unit access (unless manually enabled)

### Why This Matters for MBR Code?

- Size Constraints: With only 16-bit registers and limited addressing modes, the code must be extremely compact and efficient.
- Direct Hardware Access: The code can directly access hardware ports and memory locations without operating system mediation.
- No Modern Conveniences: No stack overflow protection, no memory management, no multitasking support.
- Immediate Hardware Control: The processor starts in real mode, so the MBR code has direct control over the hardware from the moment it runs.

### Transition to Protected Mode:

Modern operating systems quickly transition from real mode to protected mode (32-bit) or long mode (64-bit) to gain access to:

- Full memory addressing capabilities
- Memory protection and virtual memory
- Advanced processor features
- Better security and stability

The MBR's job is essentially to bridge the gap between the primitive real mode environment and loading code that can set up a more sophisticated operating environment.

## Capabilities and Constraints of MBR Code




[^0x7C00]: The BIOS loads the 510‑byte sector to segment:offset 0000:7C00, which equals physical address 0x7C00. The lower 2 KB of RAM (0x0000–07FF) already hosts the interrupt‑vector table and the BIOS Data Area, so 0x7C00 was the first convenient free gap on the original IBM PC—and the convention stuck. Immediately on entry the stub usually copies itself downward to something like 0x0600 (or 0x0500). That frees 0x7C00 so it can be overwritten by the Volume Boot Record (VBR) from the active partition that the stub is about to load. The destination (0x0600–07BF) lies safely below 0x7C00 and above the BIOS Data Area, so nothing important is overwritten. It tansfers control (jmp 0x0000:0x7C00) so the OS-specific stage-1½/2 bootloader can continue.
