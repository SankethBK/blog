MIPS III introduced 64-bit architecture in 1991, increasing the address space and register width.\nMIPS32 and MIPS64 are modern versions of the architecture, maintaining backward compatibility while introducing enhancements for modern computing needs. MicroMIPS is a compact version of the MIPS instruction set, designed for embedded systems with limited memory. MIPS processors are commonly used in embedded systems, such as routers, printers, and smart home devices, where their efficiency and performance are crucial. In the automotive industry, MIPS processors are employed in various control systems and infotainment systems, benefiting from their reliable and efficient processing capabilities. MIPS processors are increasingly found in IoT devices, providing the necessary computational power and energy efficiency for smart sensors, wearables, and other connected devices.\nMIPS is built on RISC principles, which embrace simplicity and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for learning about CPU architecture in general. Some principles of RISC are:\nSimple Instructions: RISC architectures use a small, highly optimized set of instructions. Each instruction is designed to be simple and execute in a single clock cycle (under ideal conditions in a pipelined processor). Load/Store Architecture: RISC separates memory access and data processing instructions. Only load and store instructions can access memory, while all other operations are performed on registers. This simplifies the instruction set and execution. Fixed-Length Instructions: Instructions in RISC architectures are of uniform length, typically 32 bits. This uniformity simplifies instruction decoding and pipeline design. Simple Addressing Modes: RISC architectures use a small number of simple addressing modes to keep instruction execution fast and efficient. Common addressing modes include register, immediate, and displacement. Pipelining: RISC architectures are designed to efficiently support pipelining. Instructions are broken down into stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back) that can be processed simultaneously for different instructions. MIPS32 and MIPS64 MIPS32 and MIPS64 are ISAs designed for 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs, respectively. The primary distinctions between modern MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures are found in their register size, memory addressing capabilities, and support for larger data and address spaces. Unlike ARM and x86, both MIPS32 and MIPS64 utilize 32-bit-wide instructions, regardless of whether they are operating on 32-bit or 64-bit processors.\nMIPS32 is designed for 32-bit applications, with 32-bit registers and a 32-bit address space suitable embedded systems, microcontrollers, and other applications where 32-bit processing capabilities are sufficient. MIPS64 extends the architecture to 64-bit, offering larger 64-bit registers and a 64-bit address space, suitable for high-performance computing and large-scale applications.\nSoftwares written for MIPS32 can often run on MIPS64 processors without modification due to their shared instruction set, facilitating a smooth transition to 64-bit computing, while the reverse is not possible. MIPS is very efficient ISA for compiler to target because in most cases it can be well predicted how much time a sequence of instructions will take.\nRegisters General Purpose Registers General Purpose registers are meant to be used by programmers and compilers for whatever operations required and has no special meaning to CPU. General-purpose registers are versatile storage locations within the CPU used for a wide range of tasks like holding intermediate data, operands and results of computations, and store temporary values during program execution. They are meant to be utilized by programmers and compilers as needed, without any special significance to the CPU itself.\nMIPS has 32 general purpose registers (R0 - R31), 32 floating point registers (F0 - F31) that can hold either a 32-bit single-precision number or a 64-bit double-precision number. General Purpose Registers (GPRs) in MIPS architectures are used for storing immediate values, temporary data, function arguments, and return values. They also facilitate address calculation for memory operations and control flow in branching and jumping instructions.\nIn MIPS, most registers are truly general-purpose, meaning they can be used for any purpose. MIPS programmers adhere to agreed-upon guidelines specifying how registers should be utilized. For instance, the stack pointer ($sp), global pointer ($gp), and frame pointer ($fp) are conventions rather than hardware-enforced roles, unlike in other Assembly languages like x86. The stack pointer is purely a software convention; no push instruction implicitly uses it. Using $t0 instead of $t3 as a temporary register isn’t inherently faster or better. However, there’s one notable exception: the jal instruction implicitly writes the return address to $31 (the link register).\nRegister Name Description Preserved Across Function Calls? $0 zero This register is hardwired to the value 0. It always returns 0 regardless of what is written to it. No $1 at Reserved for the assembler. It is used for pseudo-instructions and not typically used by programmers. No $2-$3 v0-v1 Used to hold function return values. No $4-$7 a0-a3 Used to pass the first four arguments to functions. No $8-$15 t0-t7 Temporary registers used for holding intermediate values. They are not preserved across function calls. No $16-$23 s0-s7 Saved registers, which must be preserved across function calls. They are used to store values that should not be changed by a function. Yes $24-$25 t8-t9 More temporary registers, similar to t0-t7. No $26-$27 k0-k1 Reserved for the operating system kernel. No $28 gp Global pointer, used to access static data. Yes $29 sp Stack pointer, used to point to the top of the stack. Yes $30 fp Frame pointer, used to manage stack frames in some calling conventions. Yes $31 ra Return address, used to store the return address for function calls. Yes When we say that saved registers must be “preserved across function calls,” it means that the values in these registers should remain unchanged when a function (subroutine) returns to its caller. In other words, if a function uses these registers, it must ensure that any values stored in them before the function call are restored when the function completes. This is typically enforced through a process called “register saving” and “register restoring”. The callee function first identifies which registers it uses that need to be preserved across function calls. These are known as “callee-saved” or “non-volatile” registers. The callee then saves the values of these registers by pushing them onto the stack. After the callee subroutine completes its task, it pops the saved register values off the stack, restoring the registers to their original state before returning control to the caller.\nSpecial Purpose Registers Special purpose register’s values are closely tied to the working of processor. For this purpose they may not be directly writeable by normal instructions like add, move, etc. Instead, some special registers in some processor architectures require special instructions to modify them. For instance, in many architectures, modifying the program counter necessitates instructions such as return from subroutine, jump, or branch. Similarly, condition code registers are typically updated exclusively through compare instructions, eg: CPSR register in ARM. This design ensures precise control over essential processor operations and status updates, safeguarding against unintended modifications that could disrupt program execution or system stability.\nIn MIPS architecture, several special registers play crucial roles in managing the CPU’s state, controlling operations, and handling exceptions. Here are the main special registers used in MIPS:\nProgram Counter (PC): Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. Hi and Lo Registers: Store the results of multiplication and division operations. If the result of an operation involving 32-bit operands is more than 32-bits, MIPS processors store the lower 32 bits of the result in the Lo register and the upper 32 bits in the Hi register. CP0: CP0 refers to the control processor, which handles various system control and status registers (CSRs) that are crucial for system operation and control. Status Register (SR): Controls the operating mode of the processor (user mode, kernel mode) and enables/disables interrupts. Cause Register (Cause): Stores exception cause information. EPC (Exception Program Counter): Holds the address of the instruction that caused an exception. EntryHi and EntryLo Registers: Used for managing TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) entries. Data Types in MIPS Byte (8-bit): Represented as .byte in MIPS assembly. Each byte consists of 8 bits. Halfword (16-bit): Represented as .half or .hword in MIPS assembly. Each halfword consists of 16 bits or 2 bytes. Word (32-bit): Represented as .word in MIPS assembly. Each word consists of 32 bits or 4 bytes. This is the default data type for many operations in MIPS32. Doubleword (64-bit): Represented as .dword in MIPS assembly. Each doubleword consists of 64 bits or 8 bytes. This is especially relevant in MIPS64 architecture. Float (32-bit floating-point): Represented as .float in MIPS assembly. This follows the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point numbers. Double (64-bit floating-point): Represented as .double in MIPS assembly. This follows the IEEE 754 standard for double-precision floating-point numbers. Addressing Modes in MIPS Addressing mode refers to the way in which the operand of an instruction is specified. Different addressing modes provide different ways to access operands, allowing for more flexible and efficient programming.\nMIPS supports several addressing modes:\nImmediate Addressing: The operand is a constant value embedded within the instruction itself. addi $t0, $t1, 5 # $t0 = $t1 + 5 Register Direct Addressing: The operand is stored in a register. add $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 + $t2 Register Indirect with Displacement The operand is a memory location and the address of that memory location is given by the sum of the register and a constant displacement encoded in the ins. This is commonly used for loading and storing the array elements. lw $t0, 8($t1), $t0 = MEM[Rt1 + 8] PC-Relative Addressing: The operand’s address is the sum of the program counter (PC) and a constant displacement. beq $t0, $t1, label # branches to the label if the values in registers $t0 and $t1 are equal, with the address computed relative to the current value of the PC. Pseudo-Direct Addressing: Used in jump instructions where the target address is partially specified in the instruction and partially from the PC. To form the full 32-bit address, the 26-bit address from the instruction is combined with the upper 4 bits of the current program counter (PC). This is because, in a 32-bit address, the upper 4 bits are often the same for instructions within a relatively small range (within the same 256MB segment). j target # jumps to an address formed by combining the upper bits of the current PC with the target address specified in the instruction. Memory Alignment and Endianness Memory alignment refers to the arrangement of data in memory according to specific boundaries. Proper memory alignment means that data is stored at memory addresses that are multiples of the data’s size. In MIPS, data must be properly aligned in memory to be accessed correctly. Attempting to access misaligned data in MIPS can lead to alignment exceptions, causing the program to crash or behave unpredictably. In contrast, x86 architecture is more flexible with memory alignment. While aligned data access is more efficient and generally recommended, x86 CPUs can handle misaligned data access without causing exceptions. The CPU might perform additional internal operations to handle the misaligned access, potentially resulting in a slight performance penalty compared to aligned accesses.\nData Types and Alignment:\n1-byte (char): No alignment requirement. 2-byte (short): Must be aligned to 2-byte boundaries. Eg: valid addresses are 0, 2, 4,.. 4-byte (int, float): Must be aligned to 4-byte boundaries. Eg: valid addresses are 0, 4, 8,.. 8-byte (double, long long): Must be aligned to 8-byte boundaries. Eg: valid addresses are 0, 8, 16,.. MIPS instructions are 32 bits (4 bytes) long and must be word-aligned. This means that the address of any instruction must be a multiple of 4. For example, valid instruction addresses in MIPS could be 0, 4, 8, and so on.\nThe .align directive in the MIPS assembler is used to specify the alignment of data in memory. While the assembler does automatically align data to the proper boundaries, the .align directive gives programmers explicit control over alignment, which can be useful for various reasons:\nEndianness: When the data stored to be stored is more than 1 byte, the sequence of bytes forming the data can be stored in two possible orders in memory:\nBig-endian: The most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address. Example: For a 32-bit integer 0x12345678, the byte order in memory would be: Address: 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 Value: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 Little-endian: The least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address. Example: For a 32-bit integer 0x12345678, the byte order in memory would be: Address: 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 Value: 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 Endianness affects how data is interpreted and exchanged between systems. If two systems with different endianness exchange data without proper handling, the data can be misinterpreted, leading to errors. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that data is correctly converted between different endian formats when necessary.\nMost modern personal computers, including those using x86 and x86-64 architectures, use little-endian format. MIPS processors can operate in both big-endian (BE) and little-endian (LE) modes. The Status register in CP0 has a bit called RE (Reverse Endian) which, when set, changes the endianness mode for user mode, such processors are called Bi-endian processors, some other examples for Bi-endian processors are ARM, PowerPC, Alpha, SPARC V9, etc.\nInstruction Formats in MIPS MIPS uses three main instruction formats: R-type, I-type, and J-type. Each format is designed to accommodate different types of instructions and their operands.\n1. R-type R-type instructions are used for operations that involve only registers, such as arithmetic and logical operations.\n31-26 25-21 20-16 15-11 10-6 5-0 opcode rs rt rd shamt funct Opcode: 6 bits - The operation code that specifies the operation to be performed. rs: 5 bits - The first source register. rt: 5 bits - The second source register. rd: 5 bits - The destination register. shamt: 5 bits- The shift amount (used in shift instructions). funct: 6 bits - The function code that specifies the exact operation (used in conjunction with the opcode). Each of the register field is 5 bits as there are 32 (25) registers.\nEg: add $t1, $t2, $t3\n2. I-type 31-26 25-21 20-16 15-0 opcode rs rt immediate I-type instructions are used for operations that involve an immediate value (a constant), as well as for memory access and branches.\nOpcode: 6 bits - The operation code. rs: 5 bits - The source register. rt: 5 bits - The destination register (or another source register for branches). Immediate: 16 bits - The immediate value, which can be a constant, address offset, or immediate operand. Eg:\naddi $t1, $t2, 10 # $t1 = $t2 + 10 lw $t0, 4($t1) # $t0 = Memory[$t1 + 4] andi $t0, $t1, 0xFF # $t0 = $t1 \u0026 0xFF 3. J-type 31-26 25-0 opcode address J-type instructions are used for jump instructions that require a target address.\nOpcode: 6 bits - The operation code. Address: 26 bits - The target address for the jump. This address is combined with the upper bits of the program counter (PC) to form the full jump address. In MIPS32, we observe that only 26 bits are used for the target address of jump instructions, even though the address space of MIPS32 spans 4GB (232). Because all MIPS instructions are 32 bits wide, they are word-aligned. This word alignment means the last 2 bits of any instruction address are always 00. Thus, only 28 bits are effectively used to form the target address. To construct the full 32-bit address, the upper 4 bits of the current program counter (PC) — which is the address of the instruction following the jump — are combined with the 28-bit target address. This results in a maximum addressable jump distance of 256MB (228).\nHowever, within a 4GB address space, it’s possible that the target instruction may be farther away than this 256MB limit. Modern assemblers employ various strategies to address this limitation, some of which we will explore later.\nPros and Cons of Uniform Instruction Width and Dedicated Opcode Spots in MIPS Pros Simplicity in Instruction Fetching: With a uniform instruction width (32 bits) for an implementation that fetches a single instruction per cycle, a single aligned memory/cache access of the fixed size is guaranteed to provide one (and only one) instruction, so no buffering or shifting is required. There is also no concern about crossing a cache line or page boundary within a single instruction.\nPredictable Instruction Fetching: With a uniform instruction width, the instruction pointer increments by a fixed amount (32 bits) for each instruction (except for control flow instructions like jumps and branches). This predictability allows the CPU to know the location of the next instruction early, reducing the need for partial decoding. It also simplifies the process of fetching and parsing multiple instructions per cycle, enhancing overall efficiency. (The need for partial decoding arises when the length of instructions varies. The CPU must determine the length of each instruction before it can identify where the next instruction begins. This requires the CPU to decode at least part of the current instruction to find out its length, a process known as partial decoding. This extra step can complicate the instruction fetching process and introduce additional overhead.)\nSimplified Parsing and Early Register Reading: The uniform instruction format in MIPS enables straightforward parsing of instruction components, such as immediate values, opcodes, and register names. This is particularly beneficial for timing-critical tasks like parsing source register names. With fixed positions for these components, the CPU can begin reading register values immediately after fetching the instruction, even before fully determining the instruction type. This speculative register reading does not require special recovery if incorrect, although it consumes extra energy. In the MIPS R2000’s classic 5-stage pipeline, this approach allows register values to be read right after instruction fetch, providing ample time to compare values and resolve branches, thus avoiding stalls without needing branch prediction. Parsing out the opcode is slightly less timing-critical than parsing source register names, but extracting the opcode sooner accelerates the start of execution. Simple parsing of the destination register name facilitates dependency detection across instructions, particularly beneficial when executing multiple instructions per cycle.\nUsage of Fewer Bits for Target Addresses: In uniform instruction sets, the alignment of instructions allows the use of fewer bits to specify target addresses. For example, in a 32-bit wide instruction set, the last 2 bits of any instruction address are always 0 due to word alignment. This means that only 30 bits are needed to represent the address instead of 32. This reduction in required bits can be exploited in certain ISAs, such as MIPS/MIPS16, to provide additional storage space for other purposes, like indicating a mode with smaller or variable-length instructions. This efficient use of addressing allows for more compact encoding of instructions and can enhance the flexibility of the instruction set by supporting different modes.\nCons Low Code Density: Uniform instruction width can lead to inefficient use of memory when instructions are shorter than the fixed width. For example, if you have a 32-bit instruction width but some instructions only require a few bits, the extra bits in each instruction are wasted. This can lead to larger code sizes and increased memory consumption.\nDecreased Flexibility due to Implicit Operands: Strict uniform formatting tends to exclude the use of implicit operands, which are operands not explicitly specified in the instruction but implied by the operation. For instance, even though MIPS mostly avoids implicit operands, it still uses an implicit destination register for the link register ($ra), which stores the return address for function calls. (When a function call is made in MIPS, the jal (jump and link) instruction is used. This instruction not only jumps to the target function address but also implicitly stores the return address (the address of the instruction following the jal) in the link register $ra (which is register $31). This behavior is implicit in the sense that the jal instruction does not need to specify that the return address should be stored in $ra; it is automatically understood and handled by the instruction.)\nCannot Handle Large Values of Immediate: Fixed-length instructions present challenges when dealing with large immediate values (constants embedded directly within instructions). In MIPS immediate values can be upto 16-bits within a single instruction. If a constant exceeds this 16-bit limit, additional steps are required to handle the larger value.\nLoading as Data: One method to handle large constants is to load them from memory. This approach involves: An extra load instruction. Overhead associated with address calculation, register usage, address translation, and tag checking. Multiple Instructions: MIPS provides two instructions lui (load upper immediate) to load the upper 16 bits of a constant and ori (or immediate) which performs bitwise OR on lower 16 bits this effectively loading a 32-bit immediate. These instructions do not involve memory access. The 32-bit immediate value is constructed directly within the CPU using two instructions. This is faster and avoids the overhead of accessing memory. Using two instructions to handle a large immediate introduces more overhead compared to a single instruction. Modern processor designs can mitigate some of this overhead. For example, Intel’s macro-op fusion combines certain pairs of instructions at the front-end of the pipeline, effectively reducing the execution overhead. Challenges in Extending the ISA: New features may require addition of new instructions to the ISA. Fixed-length instructions present a significant challenge when it comes to extending an instruction set. The number of distinct operations (opcodes) that can be represented is limited. For example, with a 6-bit opcode field (as in MIPS), there are only 64 possible opcodes. It also poses a challenge when we have to increase number of available registers as adding more registers requires more bits to encode the register addresses. To extend the instruction set without breaking compatibility, additional modes or instruction formats might be needed. This can complicate the CPU design and increase the complexity of the instruction decoder.\nLimited Address Bound for Branching Instructions: In MIPS, the jump instruction uses only 26 bits to specify the immediate target address. Due to memory alignment, the last 2 bits are always zero, effectively giving 28 bits for the target address. The upper 4 bits of the Program Counter (PC) are combined with these 28 bits to form a full 32-bit address, which limits the addressable range to 256 MB. Consequently, the assembly programmer or compiler must ensure that the target address of the jump instruction lies within this 256 MB boundary. If the target address exceeds this limit, other options must be employed, such as using the jr (jump to the address stored in register) instruction, which can specify a full 32-bit address by storing the address in a register. In some versions, the assembler will issue a warning if the target address of a j instruction exceeds the 256 MB bound. In other cases, the assembler might automatically replace the j instruction with a jr instruction to handle the full address space correctly.\nCoprocessors in MIPS MIPS is a modular architecture supporting up to four coprocessors (CP0/1/2/3). Coprocessors are specialized processing units that work alongside the main CPU to handle specific types of operations, such as floating-point arithmetic, system control, or other specialized tasks. MIPS typically defines up to four coprocessors, though not all are always implemented in every MIPS processor. These coprocessors are numbered CP0 through CP3.\nCoprocessor 0 (CP0) - System Control Coprocessor: CP0 is responsible for managing system control functions, including exception handling, memory management, and processor status. It plays a critical role in configuring and controlling the behavior of the MIPS processor. CP0 contains a set of special-purpose registers used for various control tasks, such as the Status Register, Cause Register, EPC (Exception Program Counter), and TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) management registers.\nCoprocessor 1 (CP1) - Floating-Point Unit (FPU): CP1 is dedicated to handling floating-point arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations on floating-point numbers. This offloads complex calculations from the main CPU, improving overall performance for tasks requiring floating-point computations. CP1 includes 32 floating-point registers ($f0 to $f31), which are used to store floating-point operands and results. Additionally, CP1 contains the Floating-Point Control and Status Register (FCSR), which holds various status flags and control bits related to floating-point operations. The FCSR also contains the comparison bit, which is set by floating-point comparison instructions and can be used for conditional branching.\nCoprocessor 2 and 3 (Optional): CP2 and CP3 are optional coprocessors that can be used for application-specific purposes, such as vector processing, digital signal processing (DSP), or other specialized tasks. For example, in the PlayStation video game console, CP2 is the Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE), which accelerates the processing of geometry in 3D computer graphics.\nOverview of MIPS Instructions 1. Memory Access Instructions Memory access instructions in MIPS facilitate moving data between registers and memory, as well as between general purpose, floating-point (FP), or special registers. Most of the memory access instructions are I-type and use register indirect with displacement as addressing mode.\n1. Load Family of Instructions All of the load instructions in MIPS are I-type instructions, and they follow this general format:\nLOAD \u003crt\u003e, offset(base) LOAD is the opcode for the specific load instruction (e.g., LB, LBU, LH, LHU, LW, LWU, LD, L.S, L.D). is the target register where the data will be loaded. offset is a 16-bit signed immediate value representing the displacement. base is the base register whose contents are added to the offset to form the effective memory address. Instruction Meaning Description LB Load Byte Loads a byte from memory into a register, sign-extended. LBU Load Byte Unsigned Loads a byte from memory into a register, zero-extended. LH Load Halfword Loads a halfword from memory into a register, sign-extended. LHU Load Halfword Unsigned Loads a halfword from memory into a register, zero-extended. LW Load Word Loads a word from memory into a register. LWU Load Word Unsigned Loads a word from memory into a register, zero-extended (MIPS64). LD Load Doubleword Loads a doubleword from memory into a register (MIPS64). L.S Load Single Precision Float Loads a single precision floating-point value from memory into an FP register. L.D Load Double Precision Float Loads a double precision floating-point value from memory into an FP register. LUI Load Upper Immediate Loads a 16-bit immediate value into the upper 16 bits of a register, with the lower 16 bits set to zero. Unlike other load instructions, LUI does not interact with memory. 2. Store Family of Instructions The store family of instructions in MIPS transfers data from a register to a specified memory location. All of the store instructions in MIPS are I-type instructions, and they follow this general format:\nSTORE \u003crt\u003e, offset(base) STORE is the opcode for the specific store instruction (e.g., SB, SH, SW, SD, S.S, S.D). is the source register whose data will be stored in memory. offset is a 16-bit signed immediate value representing the displacement. base is the base register whose contents are added to the offset to form the effective memory address. Instruction Meaning Description SB Store Byte Stores a byte from a register into memory. SH Store Halfword Stores a halfword from a register into memory. SW Store Word Stores a word from a register into memory. SD Store Doubleword Stores a doubleword from a register into memory (MIPS64). S.S Store Single Precision Float Stores a single precision floating-point value from an FP register into memory. S.D Store Double Precision Float Stores a double precision floating-point value from an FP register into memory. 3. Register Data Transfer Instructions These instructions facilitate the transfer of data between different types of registers, such as general-purpose registers (GPRs), floating-point registers (FPRs), and special-purpose registers. These instructions are critical in operations where data needs to be moved from one part of the CPU to another, enabling interaction between different processing units.\nThese instructions facilitate the transfer of data between two general-purpose registers.\nMFHI: Move From HI register. Transfers the content from the HI special register to a GPR. MFHI $d # $d = HI MFLO: Move From LO register. Transfers the content from the LO special register to a GPR. MFLO $d # $d = LO MOV.S: Move single-precision floating-point value. MOV.S $f1, $f2 # $f1 = $f2 MOV.D: Move double-precision floating-point value. MOV.D $f1, $f2 # $f1 = $f2 MFC0 (Move From Coprocessor 0): This instruction moves data from a specific CP0 register to a general-purpose register (GPR). It’s often used to read system control information, such as the contents of the status register, exception handling registers, or memory management configuration. MFC0 $t, $c0_reg, $sel $t: The destination general-purpose register. $c0_reg: The CP0 register number. $sel: The select field, which allows accessing different parts or subsets of the CP0 register. Example: MFC0 $t0, $12 # Move the contents of CP0 Status register (register 12) to $t0 MTC0 (Move To Coprocessor 0): This instruction moves data from a general-purpose register (GPR) to a specific CP0 register. MTC0 $t0, $13 # Move the contents of $t0 into CP0 Cause register (register 13) MFC1: Move From Coprocessor 1 (FPR) to GPR. MFC1 $t, $f # $t = $f MTC1: Move To Coprocessor 1 (FPR) from GPR. MTC1 $f, $t # $f = $t 2. Arithmetic instructions (Integers) Arithmetic instructions in MIPS perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These instructions operate on values stored in general-purpose registers (GPRs) and often involve signed and unsigned integers.\nMajority of arithmetic instructions are R-type, they follow this general format:\nARITHMETIC $rd, $rs, $rt ARITHMETIC is the opcode for the specific arithmetic instruction (e.g., ADD, ADDU, SUB, MULT). $rd is the destination register where the result of the operation will be stored. $rs is the source register containing the first operand. $rt is the source register containing the second operand. (Note: The storage format for R-type instructions is . However, when writing the instruction in assembly language, it is written as $rd, $rs, $rt.)\nImmediate operations follow I-type, the format is slightly different:\nARITHMETIC_IMM $rt, $rs, immediate ARITHMETIC_IMM is the opcode for the specific arithmetic instruction that uses an immediate value (e.g., ADDI, ADDIU). $rt is the destination register where the result will be stored. $rs is the source register containing the first operand. immediate is a 16-bit signed value that is added to the contents of $rs. Instruction Syntax Description Example ADD ADD $rd, $rs, $rt Adds the contents of $rs and $rt, stores the result in $rd. Raises an exception on overflow. ADD $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 + $t2 ADDU ADDU $rd, $rs, $rt Adds the contents of $rs and $rt without checking for overflow. ADDU $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 + $t2 (no overflow check) ADDI ADDI $rt, $rs, immediate Adds an immediate value to $rs, stores the result in $rt. Raises an exception on overflow. ADDI $t0, $t1, 10 # $t0 = $t1 + 10 ADDIU ADDIU $rt, $rs, immediate Adds an immediate value to $rs without checking for overflow. ADDIU $t0, $t1, 10 # $t0 = $t1 + 10 (no overflow check) SUB SUB $rd, $rs, $rt Subtracts $rt from $rs, stores the result in $rd. Raises an exception on overflow. SUB $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 - $t2 SUBU SUBU $rd, $rs, $rt Subtracts $rt from $rs without checking for overflow. SUBU $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 - $t2 (no overflow check) MULT MULT $rs, $rt Multiplies $rs and $rt, result stored in HI and LO registers. MULT $t1, $t2 # Result in HI:LO = $t1 * $t2 MULTU MULTU $rs, $rt Multiplies unsigned integers $rs and $rt, result stored in HI and LO registers. MULTU $t1, $t2 # Unsigned result in HI:LO DIV DIV $rs, $rt Divides $rs by $rt, quotient stored in LO, remainder in HI. DIV $t1, $t2 # LO = $t1 / $t2; HI = $t1 % $t2 DIVU DIVU $rs, $rt Divides unsigned integers $rs by $rt, quotient stored in LO, remainder in HI. DIVU $t1, $t2 # Unsigned LO = $t1 / $t2; HI = $t1 % $t2 The above instructions are for MIPS32. MIPS64 has similar instructions with a prefix letter “D” added to each instruction. The “D” indicates “Doubleword,” e.g., DADD, DADDI, DADDU, DADDIU.\n3. Logical instructions (Integers) Logical instructions in MIPS are used to perform bitwise operations on the binary representations of data stored in registers.\nLogical Instructions follow the R-type format. In this format, the instructions operate on registers and involve three operands: two source registers and one destination register.\nLOGICAL $rd, $rs, $rt LOGICAL: is the opcode for logical instruction (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NOR) $rd is the destination register. $rs and $rt are the source registers. Some instructions have immediate variants as well, which follow the I-type format.\nLOGICAL_IMM $rd, $rs, $rt LOGICAL_IMM: is the opcode for logical instruction (e.g., ANDI, ORI, XORI) $rd is the destination register. $rs and $rt are the source registers. Instruction Meaning Description AND Bitwise AND Performs a bitwise AND operation between the values in $rs and $rt, and stores the result in $rd. OR Bitwise OR Performs a bitwise OR operation between the values in $rs and $rt, and stores the result in $rd. XOR Bitwise XOR Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the values in $rs and $rt, and stores the result in $rd. NOR Bitwise NOR Performs a bitwise NOR operation between the values in $rs and $rt, and stores the result in $rd. ANDI Bitwise AND Immediate Performs a bitwise AND operation between the value in $rs and an immediate value, and stores the result in $rt. ORI Bitwise OR Immediate Performs a bitwise OR operation between the value in $rs and an immediate value, and stores the result in $rt. XORI Bitwise XOR Immediate Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the value in $rs and an immediate value, and stores the result in $rt. 4. Shift Instructions Shift instructions in MIPS perform bitwise shifts on operands stored in registers. Shift instructions are all R-type and follow this general format:\nSHIFT $rd, $rt, shamt SHIFT is the opcode for the specific variable shift instruction (e.g., SLL, SRL, SRA). $rd is the destination register. $rt is the source register that contains the value to be shifted. shamt (shift amount) is the number of bit positions to shift the value in $rt. Another type of shift instruction follows this format:\nSHIFT $rd, $rt, $rs SHIFT is the opcode for the specific variable shift instruction (e.g., SLLV, SRLV, SRAV). $rd is the destination register. $rt is the source register that contains the value to be shifted. $rs is the register that specifies the shift amount. Instruction Syntax Description Example SLL SLL $rd, $rt, shamt Shifts the contents of $rt left by shamt bits, stores the result in $rd. SLL $t0, $t1, 2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003c\u003c 2 SRL SRL $rd, $rt, shamt Shifts the contents of $rt right by shamt bits (logical), stores the result in $rd. It does not preserve the sign bit (MSB). It treats the value as an unsigned number, so the MSB is replaced with a zero. SRL $t0, $t1, 2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003e\u003e 2 SRA SRA $rd, $rt, shamt Shifts the contents of $rt right by shamt bits (arithmetic) and stores the result in $rd. It preserves the sign bit (MSB), meaning the sign bit remains unchanged during the shift operation. SRA $t0, $t1, 2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003e\u003e 2 SLLV SLLV $rd, $rt, $rs Shifts the contents of $rt left by the value in $rs (variable shift), stores the result in $rd. SLLV $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003c\u003c $t2 SRLV SRLV $rd, $rt, $rs Shifts the contents of $rt right by the value in $rs (logical, variable shift), stores the result in $rd. SRLV $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003e\u003e $t2 SRAV SRAV $rd, $rt, $rs Shifts the contents of $rt right by the value in $rs (arithmetic, variable shift), stores the result in $rd. SRAV $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003e\u003e $t2 In a left shift operation, the sign bit (MSB) is treated like any other bit. The intuition behind a logical left shift is that each shift operation corresponds to multiplication by 2. For example: 0000 1111 \u003c\u003c 1 = 0001 1110, which is 15 * 2 = 30.\nSimilarly, a logical right shift corresponds to division by 2. For example: 0001 1110 \u003e\u003e 1 = 0000 1111, which is 30 / 2 = 15. However, when applying logical right shift to negative numbers (in two’s complement representation), such as 1110 0010 (which represents -30), performing a logical right shift results in 0111 0001 (113), which is not intuitive. In contrast, applying an arithmetic right shift, which preserves the sign bit, results in 1111 0001 (-15), which is more intuitive and useful.\n5. Comparision Instruction These instructions compare the values in registers (or between a register and an immediate value) and set the destination register based on whether the condition is met.\nComparision instructions follow the R-type format, they follow this general format:\nCOMPARISION $rd, $rs, $rt COMPARISION: is the opcode for logical instruction (e.g., SLT, SLTU) $rd: Destination register where the result (1 or 0) will be stored. $rs: First source register. $rt: Second source register. They also have I-type variants\nCOMPARISION_IMM $rt, $rs, immediate COMPARISION_IMM: is the opcode for logical instruction (e.g., SLTI, SLTIU) $rt: Destination register where the result (1 or 0) will be stored $rs: Source register. immediate: 16-bit signed or unsigned immediate value. Instruction Syntax Description Example SLT SLT $rd, $rs, $rt Sets $rd to 1 if the value in $rs is less than the value in $rt, otherwise sets it to 0. SLT $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003c $t2 SLTI SLTI $rt, $rs, immediate Sets $rt to 1 if the value in $rs is less than the immediate value, otherwise sets it to 0. SLTI $t0, $t1, 10 # $t0 = $t1 \u003c 10 SLTU SLTU $rd, $rs, $rt Sets $rd to 1 if the unsigned value in $rs is less than the unsigned value in $rt. SLTU $t0, $t1, $t2 # $t0 = $t1 \u003c $t2 SLTIU SLTIU $rt, $rs, immediate Sets $rt to 1 if the unsigned value in $rs is less than the unsigned immediate value. SLTIU $t0, $t1, 10 # $t0 = $t1 \u003c 10 6. Control Instructions Control instructions in MIPS manage the flow of execution by altering the program counter (PC) based on conditions, performing unconditional jumps, and handling exceptions. These instructions are crucial for implementing loops, conditional execution, and function calls.\nControl instructions in MIPS can be either I-type or J-type and follow these general formats:\nI-Type Branch Instructions\nBRANCH $rs, $rt, offset BRANCH: is the opcode for the specific branch instruction (e.g., BEQ, BNE, BEQZ, BNEZ). $rs: The first source register. $rt: The second source register (or immediate zero for BEQZ/BNEZ). offset: The 16-bit signed offset from PC + 4 to which the program will branch if the condition is met. J-Type Jump Instructions\nJUMP target JUMP: is the opcode for the specific jump instruction (e.g., J, JAL). target: The 26-bit immediate value specifying the address to jump to, relative to PC + 4. It can also be the source register containing the target address. Instruction Syntax Description Example BEQZ BEQZ $rs, offset Branches if the value in $rs is equal to zero. Offset is 16-bit signed and relative to PC + 4. BEQZ $t0, label BNEZ BNEZ $rs, offset Branches if the value in $rs is not equal to zero. Offset is 16-bit signed and relative to PC + 4. BNEZ $t0, label BEQ BEQ $rs, $rt, offset Branches if the values in $rs and $rt are equal. Offset is 16-bit signed and relative to PC + 4. BEQ $t0, $t1, label BNE BNE $rs, $rt, offset Branches if the values in $rs and $rt are not equal. Offset is 16-bit signed and relative to PC + 4. BNE $t0, $t1, label BC1T BC1T offset Branches if the floating-point comparison bit is true. The comparison bit is located in the Floating-Point Control and Status Register (FCSR) in Coprocessor 1 (CP1). This bit is set by floating-point comparison instructions. The offset is 16-bit signed and relative to PC + 4. BC1T label BC1F BC1F offset Branches if the floating-point comparison bit is false. Offset is 16-bit signed and relative to PC + 4. BC1F label MOVN MOVN $rd, $rs, $rt Copies the value in $rs to $rd if the value in $rt is not zero. MOVN $t0, $t1, $t2 MOVZ MOVZ $rd, $rs, $rt Copies the value in $rs to $rd if the value in $rt is zero. MOVZ $t0, $t1, $t2 J J target Unconditionally jumps to the target address. The target is a 26-bit immediate value relative to PC + 4. J label JR JR $rs Unconditionally jumps to the address contained in $rs. JR $t0 JAL JAL target Jumps to the target address and stores the return address (PC + 4) in $ra (register 31). JAL label JALR JALR $rd, $rs Jumps to the address in $rs and stores the return address (PC + 4) in $rd (usually $ra). JALR $ra, $t0 TRAP TRAP code Triggers a software interrupt, transferring control to the operating system at a predefined vectored address. This instruction is used for implementing system calls or exceptions where the program needs to request services from the operating system or handle specific conditions. The code parameter is a 16-bit immediate value called system call number, it specifies the type of service or the particular action to be performed by the operating system. TRAP 0x7 ERET ERET Returns from an exception, restoring the state and returning to user mode. An “exception” generally refers to any condition that disrupts the normal execution flow of a program and requires special handling by the operating system or the CPU. These can include both software interrupt which are intentional exceptions triggered by the program, often using a TRAP instruction, to request a service from the operating system or hardware exceptions like a program tries to divide a number by zero, triggering a divide-by-zero exception. The CPU catches this, and the operating system’s exception handler is invoked. After handling the exception (perhaps by terminating the program or skipping the instruction), ERET is used to return control to the next appropriate point in the program. ERET Note: The relative offset for branching is considered from PC + 4 instead of PC because, in MIPS, the Program Counter (PC) is incremented by 4 immediately after fetching the current instruction. This means that by the time the branch or jump instruction is executed, the PC already points to the next instruction.\nTranslation of Labels in Machine Code\nWhen writing assembly code, we often use labels as targets for jumps or branches. These labels are symbolic names representing memory addresses. During the assembly process, the assembler converts these labels into actual memory locations. This allows the code to be more readable and maintainable, as labels can be used instead of hard-coded memory addresses.\nFor e.g., if the assembly code is\nstart: ADD $t0, $t1, $t2 BEQ $t0, $zero, end SUB $t3, $t4, $t5 end: NOP when it’s converted to machine code by the assembler, it will be like this (except everything including opcodes will be binary numbers)\nADD $t0, $t1, $t2 BEQ $t0, $zero, 0x00400010 # The label 'end' is converted to the memory address 0x00400010 SUB $t3, $t4, $t5 NOP During assembly, the assembler replaces each referenced label with the corresponding memory location of the code associated with that label. The assembler can calculate these addresses even before the program is loaded into memory for execution because they are virtual addresses, not physical addresses. In fact, a program does not need to be concerned with physical addresses, as the Memory Management Unit (MMU) handles the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses.\nThe assembler assumes a starting address for the program (often specified by the operating system or a linker script). As it processes the code, it assigns virtual memory addresses to each instruction and data element, incrementing the address by the size of each instruction or data element. These addresses are used for the purposes of assembly and linking, not for direct physical memory access.\n7. Floating-Point Instructions In MIPS, floating-point operations are performed using the Floating-Point Unit (FPU), also known as Coprocessor 1 (CP1). The FPU handles calculations on floating-point numbers in three formats: single-precision (SP), double-precision (DP), and paired-single (PS). These operations can involve basic arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more complex operations like multiply-add and conversion between different data types.\nSingle-Precision (SP): 32-bit floating-point numbers. Double-Precision (DP): 64-bit floating-point numbers. Paired-Single (PS): Two 32-bit floating-point values packed into a single 64-bit register. This format allows SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, enabling parallel processing of the two 32-bit values. Instruction Group Syntax Description Example Addition ADD.[D/S/PS] $fd, $fs, $ft Adds the values in $fs and $ft, storing the result in $fd. Supports DP, SP, and PS formats. ADD.D $f0, $f1, $f2 Subtraction SUB.[D/S/PS] $fd, $fs, $ft Subtracts the value in $ft from $fs, storing the result in $fd. Supports DP, SP, and PS formats. SUB.S $f0, $f1, $f2 Multiplication MUL.[D/S/PS] $fd, $fs, $ft Multiplies the values in $fs and $ft, storing the result in $fd. Supports DP, SP, and PS formats. MUL.PS $f0, $f1, $f2 Multiply-Add MADD.[D/S/PS] $fd, $fs, $ft Multiplies $fs and $ft, then adds the result to $fd. Supports DP, SP, and PS formats. MADD.D $f0, $f1, $f2 Division DIV.[D/S/PS] $fd, $fs, $ft Divides the value in $fs by $ft, storing the result in $fd. Supports DP, SP, and PS formats. DIV.S $f0, $f1, $f2 Conversion CVT.[x].[y] $fd, $fs Converts the value in $fs from format x to format y, storing the result in $fd. Formats include L, W, D, and S. CVT.S.D $f0, $f1 Comparison C.[cond].[D/S] $fs, $ft Compares the values in $fs and $ft. The condition (cond) can be LT, GT, LE, GE, EQ, or NE. Sets a bit in the FCSR based on the result. C.LE.S $f0, $f1 Pseudo-Instructions in MIPS Pseudo-instructions are higher-level assembly language instructions that simplify coding for the programmer. These pseudo-instructions are not actual MIPS machine instructions but are translated by the assembler into one or more real MIPS instructions during assembly. This translation helps make the code more readable and easier to write without worrying about the specific details of the underlying machine instructions.\nSome of the commonly used pseudo-instructions in MIPS are\nPseudo-Instruction Description Actual Instructions move $rd, $rs Copy the value from register $rs to $rd. add $rd, $rs, $zero li $rd, imm Load an immediate value imm into register $rd. If imm is small: addi $rd, $zero, imm\nIf imm is large: lui $rd, upper(imm) + ori $rd, $rd, lower(imm) la $rd, label Load the address of label into register $rd. lui $rd, upper(label) + ori $rd, $rd, lower(label) b label Unconditional branch to label. beq $zero, $zero, label blt $rs, $rt, label Branch to label if $rs is less than $rt. slt $at, $rs, $rt + bne $at, $zero, label bgt $rs, $rt, label Branch to label if $rs is greater than $rt. slt $at, $rt, $rs + bne $at, $zero, label bge $rs, $rt, label Branch to label if $rs is greater than or equal to $rt. slt $at, $rs, $rt + beq $at, $zero, label ble $rs, $rt, label Branch to label if $rs is less than or equal to $rt. slt $at, $rt, $rs + beq $at, $zero, label nop No operation; does nothing for one cycle. sll $zero, $zero, 0 li $rd, 0ximm Load an immediate hexadecimal value into $rd. lui $rd, high(imm) + ori $rd, $rd, low(imm) The register $1 (also known as $at, short for “assembler temporary”) is used by the assembler as a temporary register to hold intermediate values. Many pseudo-instructions require multiple steps to achieve the desired result. For example, the pseudo-instruction bgt (branch if greater than) is not a real MIPS instruction and needs to be translated into a combination of other instructions like slt (set less than) and bne (branch if not equal). The assembler uses $at to temporarily hold values during this process.\nFor eg: the pseudo-instruction\nbgt $t0, $t1, label needs to be translated by the assembler because there is no direct bgt instruction in MIPS. The assembler expands it as follows:\nslt $at, $t1, $t0 # Set $at to 1 if $t1 \u003c $t0 bne $at, $zero, label # Branch to label if $at is not zero Directives in MIPS Directives in MIPS are special instructions that guide the assembler during the assembly process. Unlike typical assembly instructions, directives do not correspond to machine instructions; instead, they control the organization and management of the code and data. These directives help define the structure of the program, allocate memory, and manage sections within the assembly code.\nDirectives are used for following:\nIntroducing Sections: A process in operating system consists of following segments: text, data, heap and stack. The text segment contains the executable instructions of a program, which are the compiled code that the CPU executes. It is typically marked as read-only to prevent accidental or malicious modifications. The data segment stores global and static variables that are initialized before the program starts. It has separate sub-segments for storing initialized and uninitialized data (BSS). It is a read-write segment, allowing variables to be modified during execution.. Directives like .data and .text introduce the data and text sections of the program, respectively. The .data section is for declaring variables and data, while the .text section contains the actual code (instructions). A MIPS program can have multiple .data and .text sections. These sections can be defined at different points in the source code to organize data and instructions. The assembler processes these sections and groups all the .data sections into a single data segment and all the .text sections into a single text segment in the final binary.\nAssembling Values: Assembling refers to the process of initializing and placing specific values into the memory sections of the program. Directives like .byte, .half, .word, .ascii, and .double assemble specific values into the current section. For example, .byte and .half store 8-bit and 16-bit values, respectively, while .double calculates and stores IEEE 64-bit double-precision floating-point values.\nDirective Data Type Size Memory Alignment Example .byte 8-bit integer 1 byte None (can be at any address) .data val4: .byte 0x12 .half 16-bit integer 2 bytes Even addresses (2-byte boundary) .data .align 1 val3: .half 0x1234 .word 32-bit integer 4 bytes 4-byte boundary .data .align 2 val1: .word 0x12345678 .double 64-bit double-precision floating point 8 bytes 8-byte boundary .data .align 3 val2: .double 3.141592653589793 .space Reserved memory space N/A N/A .data buffer: .space 64 (reserves 64 bytes of space) .ascii ASCII string without null terminator Variable None (can be at any address) .data val5: .ascii \"hello\" .asciiz ASCII string with null terminator Variable None (can be at any address) .data val6: .asciiz \"world\" Global and External Symbols: Directives like .globl and .extern are used to manage symbol visibility and accessibility across multiple assembly files or modules. These directives are essential in modular programming, allowing different parts of a program to share and link symbols.\n.globl sym: Declares the label sym as global, making it accessible from other assembly files or modules. This ensures that the label can be referenced during the linking process, enabling inter-file communication. .extern sym size: Declares the label sym as an external symbol, indicating that it is defined in another file or module. The size parameter specifies the symbol’s size in bytes. This directive is used to reference symbols that are not defined within the current assembly file but are needed for linking. Memory Alignment: The MIPS assembler automatically aligns data in memory according to the data type’s natural alignment requirements.The .align directive is used to ensure that the data in memory is aligned on a specific boundary, which can be critical for performance or correctness in certain architectures. The directive takes an argument that specifies the power of two for the alignment (e.g., .align 2 aligns the data on a 4-byte boundary). This is particularly useful when dealing with data types that require specific alignment for efficient access. The .align 0 directive can be used to turn off automatic alignment. For example: .align 3 aligns the data on an 8-byte boundary, suitable for 64-bit data types.\nRelocation Relocation operators are special constructs used in assembly language to handle addresses and constants that may not be fully resolved until the linking or loading phase of program compilation. They instruct the assembler and linker on how to compute and adjust addresses and offsets. They allow for the program to be loaded into different memory locations without requiring manual modification of addresses within the code.\nThe main purposes of relocation operators include:\nAllowing code to be position-independent Facilitating dynamic linking of libraries Enabling the operating system to load programs at arbitrary memory locations We can think of relocation operators as special “instructions” for the linker, much like how assembly instructions are for the CPU. They instruct the linker on how to adjust addresses in the machine code to make the program work correctly when it is loaded into memory.\nBefore delving into common relocation operators and their usage, it’s essential to understand how the memory layout of a program is decided and the roles played by the linker and the loader in this process.\nMemory Layout of a Program The memory layout of a program refers to the organization of different sections in the program’s memory during its execution. A program loaded into memory for execution consists of different sections as shown below:\n+----------------------------+ \u003c- High Memory Address (Stack starts here) | Stack | | | | (grows downward) | +----------------------------+ | Heap | | | | (grows upward) | +----------------------------+ | BSS (Uninitialized data) | +----------------------------+ | Data (Initialized data) | +----------------------------+ | Text (Code) | +----------------------------+ Text Section: Contains the program’s executable code (machine instructions). Data Section: Contains initialized global and static variables. BSS Section: Holds uninitialized global and static variables. The BSS is zeroed out when the program starts. Heap: Used for dynamically allocated memory (e.g., from malloc). The heap grows upward, towards higher memory addresses, as memory is dynamically allocated. Stack: Used for local variables and function call management (e.g., function parameters, return addresses). The stack grows downward, towards lower memory addresses. Role of Linker in building Memory Layout The linker is a tool that combines one or more object files (generated by the assembler from source code) into a single executable or library. It helps in determining the memory layout during the linking phase by:\nMerging Sections: The linker combines similar sections (like .text, .data, and .bss) from different object files into unified sections in the final executable. Resolving Symbols: The linker resolves symbol references by matching symbol definitions and uses across object files, updating addresses accordingly. Performing Relocation: It adjusts addresses in the machine code to reflect the assigned memory locations, handling any necessary calculations. Address Assignment: The linker assigns relative addresses to sections and symbols within the program. The linker can fully determine the relative (virtual) addresses for the text and data sections during the linking process, because these sections are static and do not change once assigned. However, in the case of dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs), the addresses of code and data sections may be determined at runtime by the dynamic linker, allowing them to vary between executions. Creating Additional Sections: The linker may create sections like .got (Global Offset Table) and .plt (Procedure Linkage Table) for dynamic linking. However, the linker typically cannot:\nDetermine the final absolute memory addresses where the program will be loaded. Account for runtime memory allocation or shared library loading addresses. For executables designed to be position-independent, the linker defers some relocation to be handled at load time. Common Relocation Operators and Their Usage 1. High and Low Relocation Operators: In MIPS assembly, the %hi() and %lo() relocation operators are used to handle 32-bit addresses by splitting them into two 16-bit parts. Since MIPS instructions can only handle immediate values up to 16 bits, these operators allow the assembler and linker to work with larger 32-bit addresses in a sequence of instructions.\nExample:\nlui $t0, %hi(global_var) lw $t1, %lo(global_var)($t0) In this example, the address of the global_var variable is ultimately stored in the $t1 register.\nHere the address of global_var variable is stored in $t1 register. Since the address is 32-bits, it can’t be loaded by a single instruction. So %hi calculates the higher 16 bits of the address and stores it in $t0 and then %lo calculates lower 16 bits of the address and adds it with higher 16-bits stored in $t0 which stores complete 32-bit address in $t1. It is typically used for global and static variables because they have fixed memory addresses known at link time.\nlui $t0, %hi(global_var): The lui (Load Upper Immediate) instruction loads the upper 16 bits of the 32-bit address of global_var into register $t0. The %hi(global_var) operator extracts these higher bits. lw $t1, %lo(global_var)($t0): The lw (Load Word) instruction loads a word from memory. The %lo(global_var) operator calculates the lower 16 bits of the address of global_var. These lower bits are added to the value already in $t0 (which contains the upper 16 bits), resulting in the full 32-bit address. We previously saw that the lui and ori instructions can also be used together to load a 32-bit address in a similar way. For example:\nlui $t0, 0x1234 ori $t0, $t0, 0x5678 However, this approach only works when the full 32-bit address is already known at assembly time. For global and static variables, the addresses are typically not known until link time, because these variables might reside in different sections of memory that are determined when the program is linked. This is where the %hi and %lo relocation operators come in. They act as instructions for the linker to provide the upper 16 bits (%hi) and lower 16 bits (%lo) of the address when the final memory layout is decided during the linking phase.\nLet’s consider this program\nmain.s\n.data global_var: .word 0x12345678 # Define a 32-bit variable with the value 0x12345678 .text .globl main main: lui $t0, %hi(global_var) # Load upper 16 bits of the address of global_var into $t0 lw $t1, %lo(global_var)($t0) # Load the 32-bit value from the address of global_var into $t1 # $t1 now contains the value 0x12345678 # Exit program (usually a system call or similar; this is just a placeholder) li $v0, 10 syscall Now Assembling the above program\n$ mips-linux-gnu-as -o main.o main.s To see the readable format of above machine code in main.o, we can disassemble it using\n$ mips-linux-gnu-objdump -d main.o Output\nmain.o: file format elf32-tradbigmips Disassembly of section .text: 00000000 : 0:\t3c080000 lui\tt0,0x0 4:\t8d090000 lw\tt1,0(t0) 8:\t2402000a li\tv0,10 c:\t0000000c syscall The disassembly output shows:\n00000000: This is the address of the first instruction in the main function. It’s the offset within the .text section (code section). The lui and lw instructions have placeholders (0x0) for the address of global_var. This is expected behavior because at the assembly stage, the exact address of global variables (like global_var) is not yet known. The values 0, 4, 8, and c are the addresses of the instructions within the .text section (which contains the code). Each instruction in MIPS is 4 bytes, so the addresses increment by 4. These addresses are relative to the start of the .text section, which in this object file is 0x00000000. After linking, the base address of the .text section will typically change, and the final addresses will reflect where the code is placed in memory during program execution. Each line also shows the corresponding machine code for that instruction. For eg 3c080000 is the machine code in hex for lui t0,0x0. We can also see that %hi and %lo have been removed from the machine code produced by Assembler, then how does the linker know that these operators were used?\nWhen the assembler encounters the %hi() and %lo() operators, it generates relocation entries instead of directly encoding the full address in the machine code. These entries act as instructions for the linker to modify the machine code with the correct addresses once the final layout of the program is determined.\nWe can inspect the relocation table entries by\n$ mips-linux-gnu-readelf -r main.o Output\nRelocation section '.rel.text' at offset 0x154 contains 2 entries: Offset Info Type Sym.Value Sym. Name 00000000 00000205 R_MIPS_HI16 00000000 .data 00000004 00000206 R_MIPS_LO16 00000000 .data .rel.text: This indicates that the relocation entries are for the .text section (which contains the program’s executable code). Offset 0x154: The relocation table starts at offset 0x154 in the object file. This is the file offset, not a memory address. The table lists two relocation entries, which indicate places in the code that need adjustment during linking. These are the locations where the linker will modify the machine code to insert the correct addresses for data. First Entry Offset 00000000: This is the offset within the .text section where the relocation will be applied. In this case, it refers to the start of the .text section. This is the location of the lui instruction, which uses %hi(). Info 00000205: The first part (000002) refers to the symbol index in the symbol table, which corresponds to .data. The last 3 digits (205) indicate the type of relocation which corresponds to R_MIPS_HI16. Sym.Value: The Sym.Value in a relocation entry refers to the address or value of the symbol on which the relocation operator is acting. However, it is typically set to 0 in the object file because the actual address or value is not known at assembly time and will only be resolved by the linker during the linking process. Sym.Name .data: The symbol for which the relocation is being applied is the .data section. This means that the relocation is related to accessing data stored in the .data section. Second Entry Offset 00000004: Indicates the offset within the .text section where the second relocation will be applied. Info 00000206: Similar to the previous entry, this indicates the relocation type (206 corresponds to R_MIPS_LO16), and the symbol index (000002) refers to .data. Now we can link the machine code by\n$ mips-linux-gnu-ld -o main main.o -e main We can view the disassmbled output by\n$ mips-linux-gnu-objdump -d main main: file format elf32-tradbigmips Disassembly of section .text: 004000f0 \u003c_ftext\u003e: 4000f0:\t3c080041 lui\tt0,0x41 4000f4:\t8d090100 lw\tt1,256(t0) 4000f8:\t2402000a li\tv0,10 4000fc:\t0000000c syscall 004000f0: This is the memory address where the _ftext function (or label) begins. This is the entry point of your program, set to 0x004000f0 by the linker. _ftext is a label indicating the start of the .text section First Instruction: From symbol table of linker’s output 0x00410100 is the address of global_var. Linker applied %hi function on this address and placed 0x00410000 in place of immediate value. Second Instruction: Second instruction takes lower 16 bits of 0x00410100 which is 256 in decimal. 2. Function Call Relocation with %call16 Operator: The %call16 operator in MIPS is used to generate a 16-bit offset for function calls, which is commonly seen in the context of position-independent code (PIC) or when working with dynamically linked libraries. This operator is useful for accessing functions when the exact memory address of the function may not be known at assembly time but will be resolved during linking or runtime.\nGlobal Offset Table (GOT):\nThe GOT is a table used to store the actual addresses of global variables and functions when a program uses dynamic linking. At runtime, the GOT holds the addresses of functions and global data that may not be known at link time.\nWhen we write a program that uses shared libraries or is compiled as position-independent code (PIC), the actual addresses of functions and variables are unknown until the program is loaded into memory. The GOT is used to store the real addresses after they are resolved.\nThe %call16 operator is used to compute a 16-bit offset that references a specific entry in the GOT for the function we want to call. The address of the function is not directly embedded in the code but is instead stored in the GOT, which can be updated dynamically at runtime. During linking, the linker generates relocation entries using %call16 for each function that needs to be resolved via the GOT. At runtime, the dynamic loader fills in the GOT entries with the actual addresses of the functions, ensuring that the function calls point to the correct memory location even if the program or library was loaded at a different memory address than expected. At runtime, the program first loads the address of the function from the GOT into a register, then jalr (jump and link register) instruction is used to call the function.

It was developed in the early 1980s at Stanford University by Professor John L. Hennessy. MIPS is widely used in academic research and industry, particularly in computer architecture courses due to its straightforward design and in various embedded systems applications for its efficiency and performance.</p><h2 id=history>History<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#history>#</a></h2><p>The first MIPS processor, the R2000, was introduced. It implemented the MIPS I architecture, which was one of the earliest commercial RISC processors. There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; as well as five releases of MIPS32/64. MIPS I had 32-bit architecture with basic instruction set and addressing modes. MIPS III introduced 64-bit architecture in 1991, increasing the address space and register width.</p><p>MIPS32 and MIPS64 are modern versions of the architecture, maintaining backward compatibility while introducing enhancements for modern computing needs. MicroMIPS is a compact version of the MIPS instruction set, designed for embedded systems with limited memory. MIPS processors are commonly used in embedded systems, such as routers, printers, and smart home devices, where their efficiency and performance are crucial. In the automotive industry, MIPS processors are employed in various control systems and infotainment systems, benefiting from their reliable and efficient processing capabilities. MIPS processors are increasingly found in IoT devices, providing the necessary computational power and energy efficiency for smart sensors, wearables, and other connected devices.</p><p>MIPS is built on RISC principles, which embrace simplicity and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for learning about CPU architecture in general. Some principles of RISC are:</p><ol><li><strong>Simple Instructions:</strong> RISC architectures use a small, highly optimized set of instructions. Each instruction is designed to be simple and execute in a single clock cycle (under ideal conditions in a pipelined processor).</li><li><strong>Load/Store Architecture:</strong> RISC separates memory access and data processing instructions. Only load and store instructions can access memory, while all other operations are performed on registers. This simplifies the instruction set and execution.</li><li><strong>Fixed-Length Instructions:</strong> Instructions in RISC architectures are of uniform length, typically 32 bits. This uniformity simplifies instruction decoding and pipeline design.</li><li><strong>Simple Addressing Modes:</strong> RISC architectures use a small number of simple addressing modes to keep instruction execution fast and efficient. Common addressing modes include register, immediate, and displacement.</li><li><strong>Pipelining:</strong> RISC architectures are designed to efficiently support pipelining. Instructions are broken down into stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back) that can be processed simultaneously for different instructions.</li></ol><h2 id=mips32-and-mips64>MIPS32 and MIPS64<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mips32-and-mips64>#</a></h2><p>MIPS32 and MIPS64 are ISAs designed for 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs, respectively. The primary distinctions between modern MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures are found in their register size, memory addressing capabilities, and support for larger data and address spaces. Unlike ARM and x86, both MIPS32 and MIPS64 utilize 32-bit-wide instructions, regardless of whether they are operating on 32-bit or 64-bit processors.</p><p>MIPS32 is designed for 32-bit applications, with 32-bit registers and a 32-bit address space suitable embedded systems, microcontrollers, and other applications where 32-bit processing capabilities are sufficient. MIPS64 extends the architecture to 64-bit, offering larger 64-bit registers and a 64-bit address space, suitable for high-performance computing and large-scale applications.</p><p>Softwares written for MIPS32 can often run on MIPS64 processors without modification due to their shared instruction set, facilitating a smooth transition to 64-bit computing, while the reverse is not possible. MIPS is very efficient ISA for compiler to target because in most cases it can be well predicted how much time a sequence of instructions will take.</p><h2 id=registers>Registers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#registers>#</a></h2><h3 id=general-purpose-registers>General Purpose Registers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#general-purpose-registers>#</a></h3><p>General Purpose registers are meant to be used by programmers and compilers for whatever operations required and has no special meaning to CPU. General-purpose registers are versatile storage locations within the CPU used for a wide range of tasks like holding intermediate data, operands and results of computations, and store temporary values during program execution. They are meant to be utilized by programmers and compilers as needed, without any special significance to the CPU itself.</p><p>MIPS has 32 general purpose registers (R0 - R31), 32 floating point registers (F0 - F31) that can hold either a 32-bit single-precision number or a 64-bit double-precision number. General Purpose Registers (GPRs) in MIPS architectures are used for storing immediate values, temporary data, function arguments, and return values. They also facilitate address calculation for memory operations and control flow in branching and jumping instructions.</p><p>In MIPS, most registers are truly general-purpose, meaning they can be used for any purpose. MIPS programmers adhere to agreed-upon guidelines specifying how registers should be utilized. For instance, the stack pointer <code>($sp)</code>, global pointer <code>($gp)</code>, and frame pointer <code>($fp)</code> are conventions rather than hardware-enforced roles, unlike in other Assembly languages like x86. The stack pointer is purely a software convention; no push instruction implicitly uses it. Using <code>$t0</code> instead of <code>$t3</code> as a temporary register isn&rsquo;t inherently faster or better. However, there&rsquo;s one notable exception: the <code>jal</code> instruction implicitly writes the return address to <code>$31</code> (the link register).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Register</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Preserved Across Function Calls?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$0</td><td>zero</td><td>This register is hardwired to the value 0. It always returns 0 regardless of what is written to it.</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td><td>at</td><td>Reserved for the assembler.

In other words, if a function uses these registers, it must ensure that any values stored in them before the function call are restored when the function completes. This is typically enforced through a process called &ldquo;register saving&rdquo; and &ldquo;register restoring&rdquo;. The callee function first identifies which registers it uses that need to be preserved across function calls. These are known as &ldquo;callee-saved&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-volatile&rdquo; registers. The callee then saves the values of these registers by pushing them onto the stack. After the callee subroutine completes its task, it pops the saved register values off the stack, restoring the registers to their original state before returning control to the caller.</p><h3 id=special-purpose-registers>Special Purpose Registers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#special-purpose-registers>#</a></h3><p>Special purpose register&rsquo;s values are closely tied to the working of processor. For this purpose they may not be directly writeable by normal instructions like add, move, etc. Instead, some special registers in some processor architectures require special instructions to modify them. For instance, in many architectures, modifying the program counter necessitates instructions such as return from subroutine, jump, or branch. Similarly, condition code registers are typically updated exclusively through compare instructions, eg: CPSR register in ARM. This design ensures precise control over essential processor operations and status updates, safeguarding against unintended modifications that could disrupt program execution or system stability.</p><p>In MIPS architecture, several special registers play crucial roles in managing the CPU&rsquo;s state, controlling operations, and handling exceptions. Here are the main special registers used in MIPS:</p><ul><li><strong>Program Counter (PC):</strong> Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.</li><li><strong>Hi and Lo Registers:</strong> Store the results of multiplication and division operations. If the result of an operation involving 32-bit operands is more than 32-bits, MIPS processors store the lower 32 bits of the result in the Lo register and the upper 32 bits in the Hi register.</li><li><strong>CP0:</strong> CP0 refers to the control processor, which handles various system control and status registers (CSRs) that are crucial for system operation and control.<ul><li><strong>Status Register (SR):</strong> Controls the operating mode of the processor (user mode, kernel mode) and enables/disables interrupts.</li><li><strong>Cause Register (Cause):</strong> Stores exception cause information.</li><li><strong>EPC (Exception Program Counter):</strong> Holds the address of the instruction that caused an exception.</li><li><strong>EntryHi and EntryLo Registers:</strong> Used for managing TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) entries.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=data-types-in-mips>Data Types in MIPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-types-in-mips>#</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Byte (8-bit):</strong> Represented as <code>.byte</code> in MIPS assembly. Each byte consists of 8 bits.</li><li><strong>Halfword (16-bit):</strong> Represented as <code>.half</code> or <code>.hword</code> in MIPS assembly. Each halfword consists of 16 bits or 2 bytes.</li><li><strong>Word (32-bit):</strong> Represented as <code>.word</code> in MIPS assembly. Each word consists of 32 bits or 4 bytes.

Proper memory alignment means that data is stored at memory addresses that are multiples of the data&rsquo;s size. In MIPS, data must be properly aligned in memory to be accessed correctly. Attempting to access misaligned data in MIPS can lead to alignment exceptions, causing the program to crash or behave unpredictably. In contrast, x86 architecture is more flexible with memory alignment. While aligned data access is more efficient and generally recommended, x86 CPUs can handle misaligned data access without causing exceptions. The CPU might perform additional internal operations to handle the misaligned access, potentially resulting in a slight performance penalty compared to aligned accesses.</p><p><strong>Data Types and Alignment:</strong></p><ul><li>1-byte (char): No alignment requirement.</li><li>2-byte (short): Must be aligned to 2-byte boundaries.

This address is combined with the upper bits of the program counter (PC) to form the full jump address.</li></ul><p>In MIPS32, we observe that only 26 bits are used for the target address of jump instructions, even though the address space of MIPS32 spans 4GB (2<sup>32</sup>). Because all MIPS instructions are 32 bits wide, they are word-aligned. This word alignment means the last 2 bits of any instruction address are always 00. Thus, only 28 bits are effectively used to form the target address. To construct the full 32-bit address, the upper 4 bits of the current program counter (PC) — which is the address of the instruction following the jump — are combined with the 28-bit target address. This results in a maximum addressable jump distance of 256MB (2<sup>28</sup>).</p><p>However, within a 4GB address space, it’s possible that the target instruction may be farther away than this 256MB limit. Modern assemblers employ various strategies to address this limitation, some of which we will explore later.</p><h2 id=pros-and-cons-of-uniform-instruction-width-and-dedicated-opcode-spots-in-mips>Pros and Cons of Uniform Instruction Width and Dedicated Opcode Spots in MIPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pros-and-cons-of-uniform-instruction-width-and-dedicated-opcode-spots-in-mips>#</a></h2><h3 id=pros>Pros<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pros>#</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Simplicity in Instruction Fetching:</strong> With a uniform instruction width (32 bits) for an implementation that fetches a single instruction per cycle, a single aligned memory/cache access of the fixed size is guaranteed to provide one (and only one) instruction, so no buffering or shifting is required. There is also no concern about crossing a cache line or page boundary within a single instruction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Predictable Instruction Fetching:</strong> With a uniform instruction width, the instruction pointer increments by a fixed amount (32 bits) for each instruction (except for control flow instructions like jumps and branches). This predictability allows the CPU to know the location of the next instruction early, reducing the need for partial decoding. It also simplifies the process of fetching and parsing multiple instructions per cycle, enhancing overall efficiency. (The need for partial decoding arises when the length of instructions varies. The CPU must determine the length of each instruction before it can identify where the next instruction begins. This requires the CPU to decode at least part of the current instruction to find out its length, a process known as partial decoding. This extra step can complicate the instruction fetching process and introduce additional overhead.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplified Parsing and Early Register Reading:</strong> The uniform instruction format in MIPS enables straightforward parsing of instruction components, such as immediate values, opcodes, and register names. This is particularly beneficial for timing-critical tasks like parsing source register names. With fixed positions for these components, the CPU can begin reading register values immediately after fetching the instruction, even before fully determining the instruction type. This speculative register reading does not require special recovery if incorrect, although it consumes extra energy. In the MIPS R2000&rsquo;s classic 5-stage pipeline, this approach allows register values to be read right after instruction fetch, providing ample time to compare values and resolve branches, thus avoiding stalls without needing branch prediction. Parsing out the opcode is slightly less timing-critical than parsing source register names, but extracting the opcode sooner accelerates the start of execution. Simple parsing of the destination register name facilitates dependency detection across instructions, particularly beneficial when executing multiple instructions per cycle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Usage of Fewer Bits for Target Addresses:</strong> In uniform instruction sets, the alignment of instructions allows the use of fewer bits to specify target addresses. For example, in a 32-bit wide instruction set, the last 2 bits of any instruction address are always 0 due to word alignment. This means that only 30 bits are needed to represent the address instead of 32. This reduction in required bits can be exploited in certain ISAs, such as MIPS/MIPS16, to provide additional storage space for other purposes, like indicating a mode with smaller or variable-length instructions. This efficient use of addressing allows for more compact encoding of instructions and can enhance the flexibility of the instruction set by supporting different modes.</p></li></ol><h3 id=cons>Cons<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cons>#</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Low Code Density:</strong> Uniform instruction width can lead to inefficient use of memory when instructions are shorter than the fixed width. For example, if you have a 32-bit instruction width but some instructions only require a few bits, the extra bits in each instruction are wasted. This can lead to larger code sizes and increased memory consumption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decreased Flexibility due to Implicit Operands:</strong> Strict uniform formatting tends to exclude the use of implicit operands, which are operands not explicitly specified in the instruction but implied by the operation. For instance, even though MIPS mostly avoids implicit operands, it still uses an implicit destination register for the link register (<code>$ra</code>), which stores the return address for function calls. (When a function call is made in MIPS, the jal (jump and link) instruction is used. This instruction not only jumps to the target function address but also implicitly stores the return address (the address of the instruction following the <code>jal</code>) in the link register <code>$ra</code> (which is register <code>$31</code>). This behavior is implicit in the sense that the <code>jal</code> instruction does not need to specify that the return address should be stored in <code>$ra</code>; it is automatically understood and handled by the instruction.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Cannot Handle Large Values of Immediate:</strong> Fixed-length instructions present challenges when dealing with large immediate values (constants embedded directly within instructions). In MIPS immediate values can be upto 16-bits within a single instruction. If a constant exceeds this 16-bit limit, additional steps are required to handle the larger value.</p><ol><li><strong>Loading as Data:</strong> One method to handle large constants is to load them from memory. This approach involves:<ul><li>An extra load instruction.</li><li>Overhead associated with address calculation, register usage, address translation, and tag checking.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Multiple Instructions:</strong> MIPS provides two instructions <code>lui</code> (load upper immediate) to load the upper 16 bits of a constant and <code>ori</code> (or immediate) which performs bitwise OR on lower 16 bits this effectively loading a 32-bit immediate. These instructions do not involve memory access. The 32-bit immediate value is constructed directly within the CPU using two instructions. This is faster and avoids the overhead of accessing memory. Using two instructions to handle a large immediate introduces more overhead compared to a single instruction. Modern processor designs can mitigate some of this overhead. For example, Intel&rsquo;s macro-op fusion combines certain pairs of instructions at the front-end of the pipeline, effectively reducing the execution overhead.</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Challenges in Extending the ISA:</strong> New features may require addition of new instructions to the ISA. Fixed-length instructions present a significant challenge when it comes to extending an instruction set. The number of distinct operations (opcodes) that can be represented is limited. For example, with a 6-bit opcode field (as in MIPS), there are only 64 possible opcodes. It also poses a challenge when we have to increase number of available registers as adding more registers requires more bits to encode the register addresses. To extend the instruction set without breaking compatibility, additional modes or instruction formats might be needed. This can complicate the CPU design and increase the complexity of the instruction decoder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limited Address Bound for Branching Instructions:</strong> In MIPS, the jump instruction uses only 26 bits to specify the immediate target address. Due to memory alignment, the last 2 bits are always zero, effectively giving 28 bits for the target address. The upper 4 bits of the Program Counter (PC) are combined with these 28 bits to form a full 32-bit address, which limits the addressable range to 256 MB. Consequently, the assembly programmer or compiler must ensure that the target address of the jump instruction lies within this 256 MB boundary. If the target address exceeds this limit, other options must be employed, such as using the <code>jr</code> (jump to the address stored in register) instruction, which can specify a full 32-bit address by storing the address in a register. In some versions, the assembler will issue a warning if the target address of a <code>j</code> instruction exceeds the 256 MB bound. In other cases, the assembler might automatically replace the <code>j</code> instruction with a <code>jr</code> instruction to handle the full address space correctly.</p></li></ol><h2 id=coprocessors-in-mips>Coprocessors in MIPS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coprocessors-in-mips>#</a></h2><p>MIPS is a modular architecture supporting up to four coprocessors (CP0/1/2/3). Coprocessors are specialized processing units that work alongside the main CPU to handle specific types of operations, such as floating-point arithmetic, system control, or other specialized tasks.

These coprocessors are numbered CP0 through CP3.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Coprocessor 0 (CP0) - System Control Coprocessor:</strong> CP0 is responsible for managing system control functions, including exception handling, memory management, and processor status.

CP1 includes 32 floating-point registers (<code>$f0</code> to <code>$f31</code>), which are used to store floating-point operands and results. Additionally, CP1 contains the Floating-Point Control and Status Register (FCSR), which holds various status flags and control bits related to floating-point operations.

For example: <code>0000 1111 &lt;&lt; 1 = 0001 1110</code>, which is 15 * 2 = 30.</p><p>Similarly, a logical right shift corresponds to division by 2. For example: <code>0001 1110 >> 1 = 0000 1111</code>, which is 30 / 2 = 15. However, when applying logical right shift to negative numbers (in two&rsquo;s complement representation), such as <code>1110 0010</code> (which represents -30), performing a logical right shift results in <code>0111 0001</code> (113), which is not intuitive. In contrast, applying an arithmetic right shift, which preserves the sign bit, results in <code>1111 0001</code> (-15), which is more intuitive and useful.</p><h3 id=5-comparision-instruction>5.

Unlike typical assembly instructions, directives do not correspond to machine instructions; instead, they control the organization and management of the code and data. These directives help define the structure of the program, allocate memory, and manage sections within the assembly code.</p><p><strong>Directives are used for following:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Introducing Sections:</strong> A process in operating system consists of following segments: <strong>text</strong>, <strong>data</strong>, <strong>heap</strong> and <strong>stack</strong>. The <strong>text</strong> segment contains the executable instructions of a program, which are the compiled code that the CPU executes. It is typically marked as read-only to prevent accidental or malicious modifications. The <strong>data</strong> segment stores global and static variables that are initialized before the program starts. It has separate sub-segments for storing initialized and uninitialized data (BSS). It is a read-write segment, allowing variables to be modified during execution.. Directives like <code>.data</code> and <code>.text</code> introduce the data and text sections of the program, respectively. The <code>.data</code> section is for declaring variables and data, while the <code>.text</code> section contains the actual code (instructions). A MIPS program can have multiple .data and .text sections. These sections can be defined at different points in the source code to organize data and instructions. The assembler processes these sections and groups all the .data sections into a single data segment and all the .text sections into a single text segment in the final binary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assembling Values:</strong> Assembling refers to the process of initializing and placing specific values into the memory sections of the program. Directives like <code>.byte</code>, <code>.half</code>, <code>.word</code>, <code>.ascii</code>, and <code>.double</code> assemble specific values into the current section. For example, <code>.byte</code> and <code>.half</code> store 8-bit and 16-bit values, respectively, while <code>.double</code> calculates and stores IEEE 64-bit double-precision floating-point values.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Directive</strong></th><th><strong>Data Type</strong></th><th><strong>Size</strong></th><th><strong>Memory Alignment</strong></th><th><strong>Example</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>.byte</code></td><td>8-bit integer</td><td>1 byte</td><td>None (can be at any address)</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>val4: .byte 0x12</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>.half</code></td><td>16-bit integer</td><td>2 bytes</td><td>Even addresses (2-byte boundary)</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>.align 1</code><br><code>val3: .half 0x1234</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>.word</code></td><td>32-bit integer</td><td>4 bytes</td><td>4-byte boundary</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>.align 2</code><br><code>val1: .word 0x12345678</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>.double</code></td><td>64-bit double-precision floating point</td><td>8 bytes</td><td>8-byte boundary</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>.align 3</code><br><code>val2: .double 3.141592653589793</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>.space</code></td><td>Reserved memory space</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>buffer: .space 64</code> (reserves 64 bytes of space)</td></tr><tr><td><code>.ascii</code></td><td>ASCII string without null terminator</td><td>Variable</td><td>None (can be at any address)</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>val5: .ascii "hello"</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>.asciiz</code></td><td>ASCII string with null terminator</td><td>Variable</td><td>None (can be at any address)</td><td><code>.data</code><br><code>val6: .asciiz "world"</code></td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p><strong>Global and External Symbols:</strong> Directives like <code>.globl</code> and <code>.extern</code> are used to manage symbol visibility and accessibility across multiple assembly files or modules. These directives are essential in modular programming, allowing different parts of a program to share and link symbols.</p><ul><li><code>.globl sym:</code> Declares the label <code>sym</code> as global, making it accessible from other assembly files or modules. This ensures that the label can be referenced during the linking process, enabling inter-file communication.</li><li><code>.extern sym size:</code> Declares the label <code>sym</code> as an external symbol, indicating that it is defined in another file or module. The <code>size</code> parameter specifies the symbol&rsquo;s size in bytes. This directive is used to reference symbols that are not defined within the current assembly file but are needed for linking.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Memory Alignment:</strong> The MIPS assembler automatically aligns data in memory according to the data type&rsquo;s natural alignment requirements.The <code>.align</code> directive is used to ensure that the data in memory is aligned on a specific boundary, which can be critical for performance or correctness in certain architectures. The directive takes an argument that specifies the power of two for the alignment (e.g., <code>.align</code> 2 aligns the data on a 4-byte boundary). This is particularly useful when dealing with data types that require specific alignment for efficient access. The <code>.align 0</code> directive can be used to turn off automatic alignment.
For example: <code>.align 3</code> aligns the data on an 8-byte boundary, suitable for 64-bit data types.</p></li></ol><h2 id=relocation>Relocation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#relocation>#</a></h2><p>Relocation operators are special constructs used in assembly language to handle addresses and constants that may not be fully resolved until the linking or loading phase of program compilation.

It helps in determining the memory layout during the linking phase by:</p><ul><li><strong>Merging Sections:</strong> The linker combines similar sections (like <code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code>, and <code>.bss</code>) from different object files into unified sections in the final executable.</li><li><strong>Resolving Symbols:</strong> The linker resolves symbol references by matching symbol definitions and uses across object files, updating addresses accordingly.</li><li><strong>Performing Relocation:</strong> It adjusts addresses in the machine code to reflect the assigned memory locations, handling any necessary calculations.</li><li><strong>Address Assignment:</strong> The linker assigns relative addresses to sections and symbols within the program. The linker can fully determine the relative (virtual) addresses for the <strong>text</strong> and <strong>data</strong> sections during the linking process, because these sections are static and do not change once assigned. However, in the case of dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs), the addresses of code and data sections may be determined at runtime by the dynamic linker, allowing them to vary between executions.</li><li><strong>Creating Additional Sections:</strong> The linker may create sections like .got (Global Offset Table) and .plt (Procedure Linkage Table) for dynamic linking.</li></ul><p>However, the linker typically cannot:</p><ul><li>Determine the final absolute memory addresses where the program will be loaded.</li><li>Account for runtime memory allocation or shared library loading addresses.</li><li>For executables designed to be position-independent, the linker defers some relocation to be handled at load time.</li></ul><h3 id=common-relocation-operators-and-their-usage>Common Relocation Operators and Their Usage<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#common-relocation-operators-and-their-usage>#</a></h3><h4 id=1-high-and-low-relocation-operators>1. High and Low Relocation Operators:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-high-and-low-relocation-operators>#</a></h4><p>In MIPS assembly, the <code>%hi()</code> and <code>%lo()</code> relocation operators are used to handle 32-bit addresses by splitting them into two 16-bit parts. Since MIPS instructions can only handle immediate values up to 16 bits, these operators allow the assembler and linker to work with larger 32-bit addresses in a sequence of instructions.</p><p>Example:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-asm data-lang=asm><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>lui</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>$t0</span>, %hi(<span style=color:#66d9ef>global_var</span>)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the address of the <code>global_var</code> variable is ultimately stored in the <code>$t1</code> register.</p><p>Here the address of <code>global_var</code> variable is stored in <code>$t1</code> register. Since the address is 32-bits, it can&rsquo;t be loaded by a single instruction. So <code>%hi</code> calculates the higher 16 bits of the address and stores it in <code>$t0</code> and then <code>%lo</code> calculates lower 16 bits of the address and adds it with higher 16-bits stored in <code>$t0</code> which stores complete 32-bit address in <code>$t1</code>. It is typically used for global and static variables because they have fixed memory addresses known at link time.</p><ul><li><strong>lui $t0, %hi(global_var):</strong> The <code>lui</code> (Load Upper Immediate) instruction loads the upper 16 bits of the 32-bit address of <code>global_var</code> into register <code>$t0</code>. The <code>%hi(global_var)</code> operator extracts these higher bits.</li><li><strong>lw $t1, %lo(global_var)($t0):</strong> The <code>lw</code> (Load Word) instruction loads a word from memory. The <code>%lo(global_var)</code> operator calculates the lower 16 bits of the address of <code>global_var</code>. These lower bits are added to the value already in <code>$t0</code> (which contains the upper 16 bits), resulting in the full 32-bit address.</li></ul><p>We previously saw that the <code>lui</code> and <code>ori</code> instructions can also be used together to load a 32-bit address in a similar way. For example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>lui $t0, 0x1234
ori $t0, $t0, 0x5678
</code></pre><p>However, this approach only works when the full 32-bit address is already known at assembly time. For global and static variables, the addresses are typically not known until link time, because these variables might reside in different sections of memory that are determined when the program is linked. This is where the <code>%hi</code> and <code>%lo</code> relocation operators come in. They act as instructions for the linker to provide the upper 16 bits (<code>%hi</code>) and lower 16 bits (<code>%lo</code>) of the address when the final memory layout is decided during the linking phase.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s consider this program</p><p><strong>main.s</strong></p><pre tabindex=0><code>.data

Function Call Relocation with <code>%call16</code> Operator:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-function-call-relocation-with-call16-operator>#</a></h4><p>The <code>%call16</code> operator in MIPS is used to generate a 16-bit offset for function calls, which is commonly seen in the context of position-independent code (PIC) or when working with dynamically linked libraries. This operator is useful for accessing functions when the exact memory address of the function may not be known at assembly time but will be resolved during linking or runtime.</p><p><strong>Global Offset Table (GOT):</strong></p><p>The GOT is a table used to store the actual addresses of global variables and functions when a program uses dynamic linking. At runtime, the GOT holds the addresses of functions and global data that may not be known at link time.</p><p>When we write a program that uses shared libraries or is compiled as position-independent code (PIC), the actual addresses of functions and variables are unknown until the program is loaded into memory. The GOT is used to store the real addresses after they are resolved.</p><ul><li>The <code>%call16</code> operator is used to compute a 16-bit offset that references a specific entry in the GOT for the function we want to call.</li><li>The address of the function is not directly embedded in the code but is instead stored in the GOT, which can be updated dynamically at runtime.</li><li>During linking, the linker generates relocation entries using <code>%call16</code> for each function that needs to be resolved via the GOT.</li><li>At runtime, the dynamic loader fills in the GOT entries with the actual addresses of the functions, ensuring that the function calls point to the correct memory location even if the program or library was loaded at a different memory address than expected.</li><li>At runtime, the program first loads the address of the function from the GOT into a register, then <code>jalr</code> (jump and link register) instruction is used to call the function.</li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/tags/assembly/>Assembly</a></li><li><a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/tags/mips/>Mips</a></li></ul></footer></article><section id=references><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS Architecture - Wikipedia</a></li><li><a href=https://mathcs.holycross.edu/~csci226/MIPS/summaryHO.pdf target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS Summary - College of the Holy Cross</a></li><li><a href=https://profile.iiita.ac.in/bibhas.ghoshal/COA_2021/lecture_slides/MIPS_Programming.pdf target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS Programming - IIIT Allahabad</a></li><li><a href=https://ablconnect.harvard.edu/files/ablconnect/files/mips_instruction_set.pdf target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS Instruction Set - Harvard ABLConnect</a></li><li><a href=https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~adi-yoga/CS2100/ch08/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">CS2100 Chapter 8 - National University of Singapore</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MIPS_Assembly/Instruction_Formats target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS Instruction Formats - Wikibooks</a></li><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48509093/using-different-registers-in-mips target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Different Registers in MIPS - Stack Overflow</a></li><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18024672/what-registers-are-preserved-through-a-linux-x86-64-function-call target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Registers Preserved Through a Linux x86-64 Function Call - Stack Overflow</a></li><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9609721/how-far-can-the-jjump-instruction-jump-in-memory-mips target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Jump Instruction Range in MIPS - Stack Overflow</a></li><li><a href=https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/162976/range-of-mips-j-instruction target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS J Instruction Range - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange</a></li><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6950230/how-to-calculate-jump-target-address-and-branch-target-address target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Calculating Jump and Branch Target Addresses in MIPS - Stack Overflow</a></li><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44694957/the-difference-between-logical-shift-right-arithmetic-shift-right-and-rotate-r target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Logical Shift Right, Arithmetic Shift Right, and Rotate Right - Stack Overflow</a></li><li><a href=https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/mips/directives-registers.pdf target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MIPS Directives and Registers - University of Minnesota Duluth</a></li></ul></section></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/>Sanketh's Blog</a></span> ·
