With its 16-bit registers and 20-bit address bus 1, the 8086 could access up to 1 megabyte of memory—a massive improvement over the 64KB limitation of 8-bit processors. However, it retained backward compatibility concepts that would prove both beneficial and constraining for future generations.\nWhy 20-bit Address Bus in the 8086? The 8086 used a 20-bit address bus, which was a deliberate design decision based on several factors:\nMemory Capacity: With 20 address lines, the processor could address 2^20 = 1,048,576 locations, or exactly 1 megabyte of memory. In 1978, this was considered enormous - most computers had only 4KB to 64KB of memory.\nEconomic Considerations: Adding more address lines would have increased the chip’s pin count, making it more expensive to manufacture and requiring more expensive motherboards. Intel balanced capability with cost-effectiveness.\nThe Segmented Memory Model Intel’s previous 8-bit processors contained 8-bit wide registers and 16-bit wide address bus, which can enable addressing of 2^16 = 64KB of memory. So thoeretically a program could use 64KB of memory.\nIntel’s main goal was to maintain programming familiarity while expanding addressable memory. They wanted programmers to continue thinking in terms of 16-bit addresses (which they were already comfortable with from 8-bit processors) while secretly accessing a larger memory space. The segmentation model essentially says: “You can still write programs using 16-bit addresses, but we’ll automatically map these into different 64KB ‘segments’ of the larger 1MB space.”\nThe physical address was divided into 2 parts: selector/segment and offset.\nSelector (Segment): 16-bit value stored in one of CS, DS, ES, SS, etc. Offset: 16-bit value (e.g., in SI, DI, BP, SP, or an immediate/displacement). Physical Address Calculation: physical_address = (selector × 16) + offset The idea is to express a 20-bit address using 2 16-bit registers. A selector register (CS, DS, ES, SS) indicates the starting address of the segment and the offset register (SI, DI, BP, SP) indicates the boundary of the segment. Since the offset is 16-bits, the boundary can be at a maximum of 64KB thus maintaining backward compatibility.\nWhat the diagram shows\nA segment is not a fixed block—it’s a sliding 64 KB window that can start on any 16-byte paragraph.\nSegment value = paragraph number; multiplying by 16 shifts the window left or right in 16-byte steps.\nSegment N and Segment N+1 start only 16 bytes apart, so their two 64 KB windows overlap almost completely.\nAny physical byte inside that overlap can be reached with two (or many more) different segment:offset pairs.\nBecause the window can slide to 65,536 different paragraph positions (0000h–FFFFh), the segment register must be 16 bits wide—not just 4 bits.\nThe offset (0–65535) always selects the byte inside the current 64 KB window.\nTogether, segment and offset build the 20-bit physical address:\nDisadvantages of the Segmentation Model 64 KB Segment Limit:\nEach selector covers only 64 KB (the 16-bit offset range). Although it was theoretically possible to support a higher offset which means larger segment memory for a program. Large programs or data structures must be split across multiple segments. Switching segments (e.g., changing CS or DS) adds overhead and complexity. Alias Addresses:\nThe same physical byte can be addressed by many segment:offset pairs. Example: physical 04808₁₆ = 047C:0048 = 047D:0038 = 047E:0028 = 047B:0058 Makes comparing or normalizing pointers tricky. Wrap Around after 20 bits:\nAll segments after 0xF000 reference memory positions above the 1 MB address space that don’t exist, which the 8086 chose to wrap around by ignoring the 21st bit of an address. After all, there is no 21st line in the address bus. The Real Mode Real mode is the operating mode that all x86 processors boot into, providing direct hardware access and backward compatibility with the original 8086 processor. Named “real” because it provides direct, unsupervised access to real physical memory addresses without any protection mechanisms or virtual memory translation.\nWhen an x86 processor powers on, it starts in real mode regardless of whether it’s a modern 64-bit CPU or the original 8086. This ensures that decades-old software can still run and that the boot process remains consistent across the entire x86 family.\nContents of 1MB memory layout in 8086 real mode FFFFFh ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ System ROM BIOS (64KB) │ │ • Boot code and POST routines │ │ • Hardware initialization │ │ • Interrupt handlers (INT 10h, 13h, 16h, etc.) │ │ • System services and utilities │ F0000h ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Expansion ROM Area (192KB) │ │ • Network card ROM │ │ • SCSI controller ROM │ │ • Other adapter ROM │ │ • Often partially unused │ C0000h ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Video BIOS ROM (128KB) │ │ • VGA/EGA BIOS routines │ │ • Graphics mode setup │ │ • Character font data │ │ • Display adapter firmware │ A0000h ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Video RAM (128KB) │ │ A0000h-AFFFFh: EGA/VGA graphics memory (64KB) │ │ B0000h-B7FFFh: Monochrome text memory (32KB) │ │ B8000h-BFFFFh: Color text memory (32KB) │ 90000h ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Extended Conventional Memory (576KB) │ │ • Available for programs if installed │ │ • Many early systems had less RAM │ │ • Could be used for disk buffers, RAM disks │ │ • Upper portion often used by DOS itself │ A0000h ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ ← 640KB barrier │ │ │ Conventional Memory (640KB) │ │ Main user program area │ │ │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ User Program Area │ │ │ │ • Application programs │ │ │ │ • Program data and variables │ │ │ │ • Dynamic memory allocation │ │ │ │ • TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) programs │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ DOS Kernel and System Files │ │ │ │ • COMMAND.COM │ │ │ │ • Device drivers │ │ │ │ • File allocation tables │ │ │ │ • Directory buffers │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ 00500h ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ BIOS Data Area (256 bytes) │ │ • Hardware configuration data │ │ • Equipment list │ │ • Keyboard buffer │ │ • Video mode information │ │ • Serial/parallel port addresses │ │ • Timer tick count │ │ • Memory size information │ 003FFh ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Interrupt Vector Table (1024 bytes) │ │ • 256 interrupt vectors × 4 bytes each │ │ • Each vector: segment:offset (2 bytes:2 bytes) │ │ • INT 00h-FFh handler addresses │ │ • Hardware and software interrupts │ │ • Critical for system operation │ 00000h └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Key Memory Regions Interrupt Vector Table (00000h-003FFh) Size: 1024 bytes (256 vectors × 4 bytes each) Structure: Each entry contains segment:offset pointer (YYYY:XXXX format) Purpose: The system’s “phone book” for interrupt handlers Function: When hardware or software triggers an interrupt (like pressing a key), the CPU looks up the handler address here Critical vectors: INT 08h: System timer (18.2 times per second) INT 09h: Keyboard interrupt INT 10h: Video services INT 13h: Disk services INT 16h: Keyboard services INT 21h: DOS system calls Why it’s at address 0: The CPU automatically multiplies the interrupt number by 4 to find the handler address, so INT 09h handler is at 0×4×9 = 36 (0024h).

Hardware Requirements: Different devices need different address ranges ROM needs upper memory: BIOS must be at top (reset vector at FFFFFh) Video needs fast access: Memory-mapped for performance Programs need contiguous space: Large conventional memory block The 80286 and protected mode Introduction to the 80286 The Intel 80286, released in 1982, represented a revolutionary leap in x86 architecture. While maintaining backward compatibility with the 8086, it introduced protected mode - a sophisticated operating environment that broke free from real mode’s limitations and laid the foundation for modern computing.\nThe 80286 was Intel’s answer to the growing demands for multitasking operating systems, memory protection, and the ability to address more than 1MB of memory. It powered the IBM PC/AT and became the processor that truly enabled the transition from simple DOS machines to powerful workstations.\nKey Innovations of the 80286 16MB Address Space 24-bit address bus (compared to 8086’s 20-bit) 16MB maximum memory (2^24 = 16,777,216 bytes) Maintained real mode compatibility for existing Hardware Memory Protection Privilege levels preventing user programs from corrupting system memory Segment-level protection with access rights and bounds checking Hardware-enforced security that software cannot bypass Virtual Memory Foundation Segment descriptors containing detailed memory management information Global and Local Descriptor Tables for memory organization Task switching support enabling true multitasking Addressing 24-Bit Memory The 80286 processor had 24 address bus compared to 20-Bit address bus of 8086. It had to implement the addressing in such a way that its backward compatible with 8086 processor’s addressing. Instead of extending the logic used in 8086’s real mode addressing, 80286 took an entirely different approach. The memory was still addressed with selector (16-Bit): offset (16-Bit) pairs. In real mode, a selector value was a paragraph number of physical memory. In protected mode, a selector value is an index into a descriptor table. In both modes, programs are divided into segments. In real mode, these segments are at fixed positions in physical memory and the selector value denotes the paragraph number of the beginning of the segment.\nWhile we are storing the actual physical address of the segment in descriptor table, the descriptor table entry can store other information related to the segment as well. For eg: length of the segment which can be used to check if the memory accessed by the program is within the segment, read/write flags which can be used to enforce protection, etc.\nThe Virtual Memory The idea of virtual memory is provide an illusion to a program that it is the only program running and it has access to all the memory. The 80286 introduced the foundational concepts of virtual memory to the x86 architecture, though it implemented a more limited form compared to modern processors. Understanding the 80286’s approach helps clarify why virtual memory became essential and how it evolved.\nVirtual memory creates an abstraction layer between what programs think they’re accessing (virtual addresses) and what actually exists in physical memory. The 80286 achieved this through segmentation-based virtual memory.\nSimplified Programming Model with Virtual Memory Before virtual memory, programmer had to directly manage physical addresses which is error prone and there’s a possibility of overwriting other program’s data. This also means the programmer has to know where the segments will be loaded in memory beforehand. Virtual Memory solves this issue as each segment will be under the illusion that it starts at memory address 0 and can access upto 64KB of memory.\nGlobal and Local Descriptor Tables (GDT and LDT) What Are Descriptor Tables? Think of descriptor tables as address books for the computer’s memory system. Just like you use a phone book to look up someone’s address when you only know their name, the 80286 processor uses descriptor tables to look up memory information when it only knows a selector (a kind of memory “name”).\nThe Basic Problem They Solve In real mode, programs had to deal with physical memory addresses directly:\nReal Mode Problem: Program says: \"I want to access memory at 0x12345\" CPU responds: \"OK, accessing physical memory at 0x12345\" Issues: - Programs must know exact physical addresses - No protection between programs - Programs can corrupt each other's memory - Hard to relocate programs in memory Protected mode solves this with an indirection layer:\nProtected Mode Solution: Program says: \"I want to access selector 0x0008, offset 0x1234\" CPU responds: \"Let me look up selector 0x0008 in the descriptor table...\" CPU finds: \"Selector 0x0008 points to base address 0x100000\" CPU calculates: \"Physical address = 0x100000 + 0x1234 = 0x101234\" CPU verifies: \"Access allowed? Yes. Accessing physical memory at 0x101234\" Understanding Selectors A selector is a 16-bit value that acts like a “memory ID card.” Instead of using physical addresses, programs use selectors to identify memory segments.\nIndex (bits 15-3): Which entry in the descriptor table (0-8191) TI (bit 2): Table Indicator - 0 = GDT, 1 = LDT RPL (bits 1-0): Requested Privilege Level (0-3) What Is a Descriptor? A descriptor is an 8-byte data structure that contains all the information the CPU needs to access a memory segment safely.\nBase Address (24 bits total in 80286): (Base[23..16] + Base[15..0])\nBits 15..0 from the lower section Bits 23..16 from the upper section Limit (20 bits total, but 80286 only uses 16 bits):\nLimit 15..0 (16 bits) - from Lower 32 bits Limit 19..16 (4 bits) - from Upper 32 bits (but not used in 80286) The descriptor format was designed to be forward-compatible. The 80386 later extended it to use:\nFull 32-bit base address (adding Base 31..24) Full 20-bit limit (adding Limit 19..16 with granularity bit) Final physical address calculation:\nPhysical Address = 24-bit Base (from descriptor) + 16-bit Offset (from instruction) Access Byte Format\nP (Present) - Bit 7: Indicates whether the segment is currently loaded in memory. When P=1, the segment is valid and can be accessed. When P=0, any attempt to access this segment generates a segment-not-present exception, allowing the OS to load the segment from disk (virtual memory support). DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level) - Bits 6-5: Defines the privilege level required to access this segment (0-3, where 0 is most privileged). Code running at privilege level 3 (user mode) cannot access segments with DPL=0 (kernel mode). This enforces memory protection between kernel and user space. S (System) - Bit 4: Distinguishes between application segments and system segments. When S=1, this is an application segment (code/data used by programs). When S=0, this is a system segment (like Task State Segment or LDT descriptor) used by the processor for special operations. E (Executable) - Bit 3: Determines if this segment contains executable code or data. When E=1, this is a code segment that can be executed (instructions fetched from here). When E=0, this is a data segment used for storing variables and cannot be executed. D (Direction/Conforming) - Bit 2: For data segments: D=0 means segment grows upward (normal), D=1 means grows downward (stack). For code segments: D=0 means non-conforming (strict privilege checking), D=1 means conforming (can be called from lower privilege levels without changing CPL). R (Read/Write) - Bit 1: For data segments: R=1 allows write access, R=0 makes it read-only. For code segments: R=1 allows reading the code (useful for debuggers), R=0 makes it execute-only. Code segments are never writable regardless of this bit. A (Accessed) - Bit 0: Automatically set by the CPU whenever the segment is accessed (loaded into a segment register or used). Never cleared by hardware - only software can clear it. Used by operating systems to implement virtual memory algorithms by tracking which segments are actively being used. Flags Field (4 bits) Bit 3: G (Granularity)\nG = 0: Limit is in bytes (fine granularity)\nSegment can be 1 byte to 1 MB in size Limit value is used directly G = 1: Limit is in 4KB pages (page granularity)\nSegment can be 4KB to 4GB in size CPU automatically shifts limit left by 12 bits (multiplies by 4096) Bit 2: D/B (Default/Big)\nFor Code Segments: Controls default operand/address size\nD = 0: 16-bit mode (8086/80286 compatible) D = 1: 32-bit mode (80386+ native) For Data Segments: Controls stack pointer size\nB = 0: Stack uses SP (16-bit stack pointer) B = 1: Stack uses ESP (32-bit stack pointer) Bit 1: L (Long Mode)\nFor 64-bit mode only (not relevant for 80286) L = 0: Not a 64-bit code segment L = 1: 64-bit code segment (x86-64 mode) Rule: If L = 1, then D must = 0 Bit 0: AVL (Available)\nAvailable for system software use Not used by CPU hardware OS can use for its own purposes Examples: Process tracking, debugging flags, memory management hints Global Descriptor Table (GDT) The Global Descriptor Table is a system-wide table containing descriptors that all tasks can potentially access. Think of it as the “public directory” of memory segments.\nGDT Structure and Location Physical Memory Layout: ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ System RAM │ │ │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ GDT │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 0: NULL Descriptor (required) │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 1: Kernel Code Segment │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 2: Kernel Data Segment │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 3: User Code Segment │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 4: User Data Segment │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 5: Task A's LDT Descriptor │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 6: Task A's TSS Descriptor │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 7: Task B's LDT Descriptor │ │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Entry 8: Task B's TSS Descriptor │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ GDTR Register (inside CPU): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Base Address: Points to start of GDT in memory │ │ Limit: Size of GDT - 1 │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ What Goes in the GDT?

Think of it as each task’s “private address book.”\nKey Differences: GDT vs LDT GDT (Global - Shared): LDT (Local - Private): ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────┐ │ • One per system │ │ • One per task │ │ • Shared by all │ │ • Private to task │ │ • System resources │ │ • Task resources │ │ • Always available │ │ • Only when task │ │ │ │ is running │ └─────────────────────┘ └─────────────────────┘ How LDTs Work Step 1: LDT Descriptor in GDT The GDT contains a descriptor that points to each task’s LDT:\nGDT Entry 5 (Text Editor's LDT): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Base: 0x200000 ← Physical address where LDT is stored │ │ Limit: 0x1000 ← LDT can hold up to 512 descriptors │ │ Type: LDT ← This is an LDT descriptor │ │ DPL: 0 ← Ring 0 (system manages LDTs) │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Step 2: LDT Contains Task’s Private Descriptors\nAt physical address 0x200000 (Text Editor's LDT): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Entry 0: NULL │ │ Entry 1: Text Editor Code Segment │ │ Entry 2: Text Editor Data Segment │ │ Entry 3: Text Editor Stack Segment │ │ Entry 4: Document Buffer Segment │ │ Entry 5: Font Library Segment │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ LDT Entries LDT entries follow the exact same 8-byte descriptor format as GDT entries. An LDT is a block of (linear) memory up to 64K in size, just like the GDT. The difference from the GDT is in the Descriptors that it can store, and the method used to access it.\nBoth use the same:\n64-bit (8-byte) descriptor structure Same Base/Limit/Access byte/Flags layout Same bit positions for all fields However, there are content restrictions for LDT:\nLDT cannot hold system segments (Task State Segments and Local Descriptor Tables) LDT can only contain application segments (code/data) and some gates GDT can contain everything (application segments, system segments, LDT descriptors, TSS descriptors) What Are Gates? Gates are special descriptors that act as “doorways” for controlled transfers of execution. Unlike regular segment descriptors that point to memory regions, gates contain entry points (addresses) where execution should transfer to.\nTypes of Gates in x86: 1. Call Gates\nPurpose: Allow controlled calls from lower privilege code to higher privilege code Function: Like a “secure function pointer” - lets user code (Ring 3) safely call kernel functions (Ring 0) Contains: Target code segment selector + offset where to jump Security: CPU automatically checks privilege levels and switches stacks if needed 2. Task Gates\nPurpose: Trigger hardware task switches Function: Points to a TSS descriptor to switch to a different task Contains: TSS selector that identifies which task to switch to Usage: Can be placed in IDT for task-switching interrupts 3. Interrupt Gates\nPurpose: Handle interrupts and exceptions Function: Similar to call gates but for interrupt handling Contains: Target code segment + interrupt handler address Behavior: Automatically disables interrupts when called 4. Trap Gates\nPurpose: Handle exceptions and software interrupts Function: Like interrupt gates but doesn’t disable interrupts Contains: Target code segment + exception handler address Usage: For system calls and debugging exceptions Why Gates Can Be in LDT:\nWhile LDT cannot contain system segments (TSS, LDT descriptors), it can contain gates because:\nCall gates: Allow process-specific entry points to system services Task gates: Could theoretically allow process-specific task switching (though rarely used) Example Use Case:\nProcess A's LDT might contain: ├── Code Segment (Ring 3) ├── Data Segment (Ring 3) ├── Call Gate → Kernel function for file I/O └── Call Gate → Kernel function for memory allocation This way, each process can have its own set of “approved” kernel entry points through call gates in their private LDT, while the kernel maintains control over exactly which functions can be called and how.\nIn practice: Modern operating systems rarely use LDTs or gates, preferring software-based system call mechanisms and paging-based memory protection. But the hardware still supports these features for compatibility and specialized use cases.\nGDTR and LDTR The processor locates the GDT and the current LDT in memory by means of the GDTR and LDTR registers. These registers store the base addresses of the tables in the linear address space and store the segment limits.\nGDTR (Global Descriptor Table Register): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ GDTR - Simple pointer structure │ ├─────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┤ │ Base Address (32-bit) │ Limit (16-bit) │ │ Linear address of GDT in memory │ Size of GDT - 1 │ └─────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘ Direct pointer to GDT location in memory Loaded with LGDT instruction Contains actual memory address and size LDTR (Local Descriptor Table Register): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ LDTR - Segment register with selector + cached descriptor │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Visible: LDT Selector (16-bit) │ ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Hidden: Cached LDT Descriptor (64-bit) │ │ Base + Limit + Access Rights from GDT entry │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Indirect reference through GDT selector The LDT is defined as a ’normal’ memory Segment inside the GDT - simply with a Base memory address and Limit Loaded with LLDT instruction using a selector CPU automatically fetches LDT descriptor from GDT and caches it The Relationship:\nGDTR points directly to GDT in memory LDTR contains a selector that points to an entry within the GDT That GDT entry describes where the LDT is located CPU caches that LDT descriptor information from GDT in LDTR’s hidden part WHo can Read/Write into GDTR and LDTR registers?

System Boot Sequence:\n1. CPU starts in Real Mode (no GDTR/LDTR) 2. Bootloader loads OS kernel 3. Kernel creates initial GDT in memory 4. Kernel executes LGDT to set GDTR 5. Kernel switches to Protected Mode 6. Kernel can now create LDTs and set LDTR as needed 2. GDT Creation (by OS Kernel):\n// Kernel code (Ring 0) during boot struct gdt_entry gdt[8]; // Array in kernel memory // Set up null descriptor (entry 0) gdt[0] = {0}; // Set up kernel code segment (entry 1) gdt[1] = {base: 0, limit: 0xFFFFF, access: 0x9A, flags: 0xC}; // Set up kernel data segment (entry 2) gdt[2] = {base: 0, limit: 0xFFFFF, access: 0x92, flags: 0xC}; // Set up user code segment (entry 3) gdt[3] = {base: 0, limit: 0xFFFFF, access: 0xFA, flags: 0xC}; // More entries... // Load the GDT struct gdt_ptr { uint16_t limit; uint32_t base; } gdt_descriptor = {sizeof(gdt)-1, (uint32_t)gdt}; asm(\"lgdt %0\" : : \"m\"(gdt_descriptor)); Who Can Read/Write GDT and LDT? Reading:\nGDT/LDT contents: Any code can read (they’re just memory) GDTR/LDTR values: SGDT/SLDT instructions (Ring 0 only)\nWriting:\nGDT/LDT contents: Only Ring 0 code should modify (by convention) GDTR/LDTR registers: Only Ring 0 via LGDT/LLDT\nMemory Protection:\nGDT location: Kernel typically places GDT in kernel-only memory pages LDT location: Can be in user-accessible memory (but user can’t change LDTR)\nPost 80386 Era SGDT/SLDT: Ring 3 accessible (any privilege level) LGDT/LLDT: Still Ring 0 only Why Intel Made This Change:\nPractical Reasons:\nDebugging tools: Debuggers and system utilities needed to examine system state Virtual machines: VM software needed to read GDT/IDT information System monitoring: Performance tools and diagnostics required access Compatibility: Some software had legitimate needs to read (not write) this info Security Analysis:\nReading GDTR/IDTR: Reveals memory layout but doesn’t grant control Still protected: Only reading allowed - writing still requires Ring 0 Limited exposure: Knowing GDT location doesn’t directly compromise security Modern Usage:\nThis change enabled:\nHypervisors: VMware, VirtualBox can inspect guest OS descriptor tables Security tools: Rootkit detectors can examine system structures Debuggers: WinDbg, GDB can show detailed system state OS utilities: System information tools can display memory management details Task State Segment (TSS) The Task State Segment (TSS) is a special data structure that contains the complete execution state of a task (program). Think of it as a “snapshot” that captures everything the CPU needs to know about a task - all its registers, memory settings, and execution context.\nBefore the 80286, task switching was a manual, error-prone process:\nManual Task Switching (8086 era): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ 1.

The MMU in the 80286 is a hardware component integrated into the CPU chip itself. THe main purpose of MMU is to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses, along with checking bounds, enforcing privileges, etc.\nKey MMU Functions Introduced by 80286 1.

The 80386 would later add paging to create the “full” MMU architecture that became the standard for modern computing.\nHow 80286 Keeps Track of the CPU Mode CR0 (Control Register 0) also called as MSW (Machine Status Word) stored PE bit (bit 0) which kept track of thr current processor mode.\nCR0 Register and the PE Bit CR0 Register (16-bit in 80286): ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────---┐ │ 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────---──┤ │ Reserved │PE │ │ (bits 15-1) │ │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────---───────────┘ │ └─ PE (Protection Enable) bit PE Bit (Bit 0):\nPE = 0: Real mode (8086 compatibility mode) PE = 1: Protected mode (full 80286 protection features) Real Mode to Protected Mode Switch ; Switching from real mode to protected mode enter_protected_mode: cli ; Disable interrupts ; Set up GDT lgdt [gdt_descriptor] ; Set up IDT lidt [idt_descriptor] ; Enable protected mode mov ax, cr0 or ax, 1 ; Set PE bit (bit 0) mov cr0, ax ; CR0.PE = 1 → Protected mode ; Far jump to flush instruction queue jmp 0x0008:protected_start ; Jump to protected mode code protected_start: ; Now in protected mode ; Set up segment registers mov ax, 0x0010 ; Data segment selector mov ds, ax mov es, ax mov ss, ax sti ; Re-enable interrupts ret Only Ring 0 code can modify CR0 - this is one of the most fundamental privilege restrictions in the 80286. There was no way to switch back to real mode once the CPU enters protected mode in 80286.\nRing Level Privileges in 80286 One of the most revolutionary features introduced by the Intel 80286 was its ring-based privilege system - a hardware-enforced security mechanism that fundamentally changed how computer systems protect themselves from malicious or buggy software. Before the 80286, programs had unrestricted access to all system resources, meaning a single misbehaving application could crash the entire computer or corrupt critical system data.\nThe 80286’s ring system solved this by creating four distinct privilege levels (Rings 0-3), arranged in a hierarchical structure where each ring has specific permissions and access rights. Think of it like security clearance levels in a government building - higher clearance (lower ring numbers) grants access to more sensitive areas, while lower clearance (higher ring numbers) restricts what you can access.\nThe 80286’s ring system introduced hardware-enforced separation between different types of code, ensuring that:\nUser applications (Ring 3) could only access their own resources Operating system code (Ring 0) maintained exclusive control over critical hardware Device drivers (Ring 1) had controlled access to specific hardware components System services (Ring 2) provided a middle layer for specialized operations Modern CPU’s removed ring 1 and ring 2 as they are not used by any applications because of complex privilege transitions.\nRing 0: The Kernel Domain Ring 0 represents the most trusted code in the system - the operating system kernel itself.

Save current state (CS:IP, FLAGS, SS:SP) │ │ 2. Look up interrupt handler in IDT │ │ 3. Check privilege level of handler │ │ 4. Switch to Ring 0 stack (from TSS) │ │ 5. Load Ring 0 code segment │ │ 6. Jump to interrupt handler │ │ │ │ Kernel Handler (Ring 0): │ │ ; Process the system call │ │ ; Perform privileged operations │ │ IRET ; Return to user program │ │ │ │ Hardware automatically: │ │ 1. Restore user state (CS:IP, FLAGS, SS:SP) │ │ 2. Switch back to Ring 3 stack │ │ 3. Continue user program execution │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 2. Call Gates: Controlled Ring Transitions Call gates provide a mechanism for controlled transitions between privilege levels without using interrupts.\nCall Gate Structure: ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ • Target segment selector │ │ • Target offset within segment │ │ • Parameter count (for stack copying) │ │ • Access rights (privilege levels) │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Usage: CALL gate_selector ; Far call through call gate ; Hardware handles privilege transition 3. Interrupt and Trap Gates Interrupt gates and trap gates handle hardware interrupts and software exceptions while managing privilege transitions.\nInterrupt Handling: ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Hardware Interrupt (e.g., keyboard, timer): │ │ 1. Save current privilege level │ │ 2. Switch to Ring 0 (interrupt handlers run in Ring 0) │ │ 3. Execute interrupt service routine │ │ 4. Restore previous privilege level │ │ │ │ This allows Ring 3 programs to be interrupted safely │ │ without compromising system security │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ How Does CPU/MMU Enforces the Privilege Check at Hardware Level? The CPU/MMU has no concept of “operating system” vs “application program.” It only understands:\nCurrent Privilege Level (CPL) Descriptor Privilege Levels (DPL) Access permissions based on these levels So CPU doesn’t know the difference between the Operating System’s code and a User Space program’s code. How does it know who should actually have higher level of privileges and who doesn’t?\nThe “First Mover Advantage” Principle 1. Bootstrap Sequence:\n1. CPU powers on in Real Mode (no protection) 2. BIOS/Bootloader runs (still no protection) 3. First OS code loads and runs (still no protection) 4. OS sets up GDT with itself as Ring 0 5. OS switches to Protected Mode 6. NOW protection is active - OS controls everything 2. OS Establishes Its Authority:\n// OS creates GDT during boot (while still unprotected) GDT[0] = NULL_DESCRIPTOR; GDT[1] = {base: 0, limit: 4GB, DPL: 0, type: CODE}; // OS code GDT[2] = {base: 0, limit: 4GB, DPL: 0, type: DATA}; // OS data GDT[3] = {base: 0, limit: 4GB, DPL: 3, type: CODE}; // User code GDT[4] = {base: 0, limit: 4GB, DPL: 3, type: DATA}; // User data // OS loads itself into Ring 0 CS = 0x08; // Ring 0 code segment // Now CPL = 0, and OS controls all privilege decisions But There’s a Catch - Memory Segmentation Isn’t Full Protection 80286 Segmentation Limitations:\nSame linear address space: All segments can point to the same memory No memory isolation: Ring 3 code can potentially read Ring 0 memory if descriptors allow it Descriptor-dependent: Protection Example Problem:\n// OS sets up segments (Ring 0 privilege required) GDT[1] = {base: 0x100000, limit: 64KB, DPL: 0}; // OS memory GDT[3] = {base: 0x100000, limit: 64KB, DPL: 3}; // User memory // Problem: Both point to SAME physical memory! // User can read OS memory through their own descriptor How 80286 Changed the CPU-OS Relationship Forever 8086 Era: OS as Optional Helper In the 8086 real mode world, the relationship between CPU and operating system was surprisingly casual:\nNo memory protection - any program could access any memory location No privilege levels - all code ran with identical hardware access Direct hardware control - programs could manipulate I/O ports, interrupts, and system resources directly OS was essentially a library - DOS functioned as a collection of utility functions that programs could call, but could easily bypass You could write a program that completely ignored DOS, accessed hardware directly, modified interrupt vectors, or even overwrote parts of DOS in memory. Running a program “with” or “without” an operating system made little architectural difference - the CPU imposed no restrictions.\n80286: The Partnership Revolution The 80286 introduced a radical concept: hardware features that required OS cooperation. Neither the CPU nor the OS could provide modern computing features alone - they had to work as partners.\nHardware Features Demanding OS Management: GDT/LDT setup - CPU provides descriptor table mechanism, but OS must create and manage the actual tables TSS management - CPU can switch tasks via hardware, but OS must set up Task State Segments for each process Privilege level enforcement - CPU enforces ring-based protection, but OS must define what gets what privileges Segment descriptors - CPU checks access rights, but OS must create proper access permissions and memory limits Protected mode switching - Complex initialization sequence requiring intimate OS-hardware coordination The New Partnership Model: Hardware provides MECHANISMS ↓ OS provides POLICIES ↓ CPU enforces what OS defines Why This Partnership Was Essential: 1. Memory Protection: CPU can only protect memory if OS properly sets up segment descriptors 2. Multitasking: TSS structure is meaningless without OS task scheduling to utilize it 3. Privilege Separation: Ring levels only work if OS correctly manages user/kernel boundaries 4. Resource Management: I/O permission bitmaps need OS policy to define task capabilities An address bus is a collection of wires (or electrical pathways) that carries memory addresses from the processor to memory and other components. Think of it as the “postal system” of the computer - when the CPU wants to read from or write to a specific location in memory, it sends that location’s address through the address bus. Each wire in the address bus represents one bit of the address. The CPU sets each wire to either high voltage (representing binary 1) or low voltage (representing binary 0) to form the complete binary address. ↩︎\n(Serial Ports) Communication ports for devices like modems, mice, or serial printers. Each COM port has a base I/O address (COM1 typically at 3F8h, COM2 at 2F8h, etc.). The BIOS Data Area stores these addresses so software knows where to find each serial port. ↩︎\n(Parallel Ports) “Line Printer” ports primarily used for parallel printers. LPT1 typically uses I/O address 378h. These were the standard way to connect printers before USB existed. The BIOS stores the base addresses of installed parallel ports. ↩︎\nWhether Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock, Num Lock, or Scroll Lock are currently pressed or toggled. This is stored as bit flags in memory location 0040:0017h. ↩︎\nA circular buffer (usually 15-16 characters) that stores keystrokes when they’re typed faster than the program can process them. This prevents losing keystrokes during busy periods. ↩︎\nThis bitmap, usually set up by the operating system when a task is started, specifies individual ports to which the program should have access. The I/O bitmap is a bit array of port access permissions; if the program has permission to access a port, a “0” is stored at the corresponding bit index, and if the program does not have permission, a “1” is stored there. When a program issues an x86 I/O port instruction such as IN or OUT, the hardware will do an I/O privilege level (IOPL) check to see if the program has access to all I/O ports. If the Current Privilege Level (CPL) of the program is numerically greater than the I/O Privilege level (IOPL), the program does not have I/O port access to all ports. If the IOPL check fails, the CPU then consults the I/O bitmap to see if this specific port is allowed. It prevents malicious programs from accessing hardware directly by stopping user programs from interfering with system devices. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"13173","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sanketh"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/posts/cpu/2025-07-20-processor-modes/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Sanketh's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/ accesskey=h title="Sanketh's Blog (Alt + H)">Sanketh's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Designed by a team led by Stephen Morse, the 8086 was Intel&rsquo;s answer to the growing demand for more powerful processors that could handle larger programs and address more memory than the existing 8-bit chips of the era.</p><p>The processor introduced the x86 architecture that would become the foundation for decades of computing evolution. With its 16-bit registers and 20-bit address bus <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, the 8086 could access up to 1 megabyte of memory—a massive improvement over the 64KB limitation of 8-bit processors. However, it retained backward compatibility concepts that would prove both beneficial and constraining for future generations.</p><h3 id=why-20-bit-address-bus-in-the-8086>Why 20-bit Address Bus in the 8086?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-20-bit-address-bus-in-the-8086>#</a></h3><p>The 8086 used a 20-bit address bus, which was a deliberate design decision based on several factors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Memory Capacity:</strong> With 20 address lines, the processor could address 2^20 = 1,048,576 locations, or exactly 1 megabyte of memory. In 1978, this was considered enormous - most computers had only 4KB to 64KB of memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economic Considerations:</strong> Adding more address lines would have increased the chip&rsquo;s pin count, making it more expensive to manufacture and requiring more expensive motherboards. Intel balanced capability with cost-effectiveness.</p></li></ul><h2 id=the-segmented-memory-model>The Segmented Memory Model<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-segmented-memory-model>#</a></h2><p>Intel&rsquo;s previous 8-bit processors contained 8-bit wide registers and 16-bit wide address bus, which can enable addressing of 2^16 = 64KB of memory. So thoeretically a program could use 64KB of memory.</p><p>Intel&rsquo;s main goal was to maintain programming familiarity while expanding addressable memory. They wanted programmers to continue thinking in terms of 16-bit addresses (which they were already comfortable with from 8-bit processors) while secretly accessing a larger memory space. The segmentation model essentially says: &ldquo;You can still write programs using 16-bit addresses, but we&rsquo;ll automatically map these into different 64KB &lsquo;segments&rsquo; of the larger 1MB space.&rdquo;</p><p>The physical address was divided into 2 parts: selector/segment and offset.</p><ul><li><strong>Selector (Segment):</strong> 16-bit value stored in one of CS, DS, ES, SS, etc.</li><li><strong>Offset:</strong> 16-bit value (e.g., in SI, DI, BP, SP, or an immediate/displacement).</li><li><strong>Physical Address Calculation:</strong> physical_address = (selector × 16) + offset</li></ul><p>The idea is to express a 20-bit address using 2 16-bit registers. A selector register (CS, DS, ES, SS) indicates the starting address of the segment and the offset register (SI, DI, BP, SP) indicates the boundary of the segment. Since the offset is 16-bits, the boundary can be at a maximum of 64KB thus maintaining backward compatibility.</p><p><img alt="Segmentation Model" loading=lazy src=/blog/images/segmentation-memory-model.png></p><p><strong>What the diagram shows</strong></p><ol><li><p>A <em>segment</em> is not a fixed block—it’s a <strong>sliding 64 KB window</strong> that can start on <strong>any 16-byte paragraph</strong>.<br><em>Segment value = paragraph number; multiplying by 16 shifts the window left or right in 16-byte steps.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Segment N</strong> and <strong>Segment N+1</strong> start only 16 bytes apart, so their two 64 KB windows overlap almost completely.<br>Any physical byte inside that overlap can be reached with two (or many more) different <em>segment:offset</em> pairs.</p></li><li><p>Because the window can slide to <strong>65,536</strong> different paragraph positions (0000h–FFFFh), the segment register must be <strong>16 bits</strong> wide—not just 4 bits.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>offset</strong> (0–65535) always selects the byte inside the current 64 KB window.<br>Together, <em>segment</em> and <em>offset</em> build the 20-bit physical address:</p></li></ol><h3 id=disadvantages-of-the-segmentation-model>Disadvantages of the Segmentation Model<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#disadvantages-of-the-segmentation-model>#</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>64 KB Segment Limit:</strong></p><ul><li>Each selector covers only 64 KB (the 16-bit offset range). Although it was theoretically possible to support a higher offset which means larger segment memory for a program.</li><li>Large programs or data structures must be split across multiple segments.</li><li>Switching segments (e.g., changing CS or DS) adds overhead and complexity.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Alias Addresses:</strong></p><ul><li>The same physical byte can be addressed by many segment:offset pairs.</li><li>Example: physical 04808₁₆ = 047C:0048 = 047D:0038 = 047E:0028 = 047B:0058</li><li>Makes comparing or normalizing pointers tricky.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wrap Around after 20 bits:</strong></p><ul><li>All segments after 0xF000 reference memory positions above the 1 MB address space that don’t exist, which the 8086 chose to wrap around by ignoring the 21st bit of an address. After all, there is no 21st line in the address bus.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=the-real-mode>The Real Mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-real-mode>#</a></h3><p>Real mode is the operating mode that all x86 processors boot into, providing direct hardware access and backward compatibility with the original 8086 processor. Named &ldquo;real&rdquo; because it provides direct, unsupervised access to real physical memory addresses without any protection mechanisms or virtual memory translation.</p><p>When an x86 processor powers on, it starts in real mode regardless of whether it&rsquo;s a modern 64-bit CPU or the original 8086. This ensures that decades-old software can still run and that the boot process remains consistent across the entire x86 family.</p><h4 id=contents-of-1mb-memory-layout-in-8086-real-mode>Contents of 1MB memory layout in 8086 real mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#contents-of-1mb-memory-layout-in-8086-real-mode>#</a></h4><pre tabindex=0><code>

It powered the IBM PC/AT and became the processor that truly enabled the transition from simple DOS machines to powerful workstations.</p><h2 id=key-innovations-of-the-80286>Key Innovations of the 80286<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-innovations-of-the-80286>#</a></h2><h3 id=16mb-address-space>16MB Address Space<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#16mb-address-space>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>24-bit address bus</strong> (compared to 8086&rsquo;s 20-bit)</li><li><strong>16MB maximum memory</strong> (2^24 = 16,777,216 bytes)</li><li><strong>Maintained real mode compatibility</strong> for existing</li></ul><h3 id=hardware-memory-protection>Hardware Memory Protection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hardware-memory-protection>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Privilege levels</strong> preventing user programs from corrupting system memory</li><li><strong>Segment-level protection</strong> with access rights and bounds checking</li><li><strong>Hardware-enforced security</strong> that software cannot bypass</li></ul><h3 id=virtual-memory-foundation>Virtual Memory Foundation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#virtual-memory-foundation>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Segment descriptors</strong> containing detailed memory management information</li><li><strong>Global and Local Descriptor Tables</strong> for memory organization</li><li><strong>Task switching support</strong> enabling true multitasking</li></ul><h2 id=addressing-24-bit-memory>Addressing 24-Bit Memory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#addressing-24-bit-memory>#</a></h2><p>The 80286 processor had 24 address bus compared to 20-Bit address bus of 8086. It had to implement the addressing in such a way that its backward compatible with 8086 processor&rsquo;s addressing. Instead of extending the logic used in 8086&rsquo;s real mode addressing, 80286 took an entirely different approach. The memory was still addressed with <code>selector (16-Bit): offset (16-Bit)</code> pairs. In real mode, a selector value was a paragraph number of physical memory. In protected mode, a selector value is an index into a descriptor table. In both modes, programs are divided into segments. In real mode, these segments are at fixed positions in physical memory and the selector value denotes the paragraph number of the beginning of the segment.</p><p>While we are storing the actual physical address of the segment in descriptor table, the descriptor table entry can store other information related to the segment as well. For eg: length of the segment which can be used to check if the memory accessed by the program is within the segment, read/write flags which can be used to enforce protection, etc.</p><p><img alt="Descriptor Table" loading=lazy src=/blog/images/descriptor-table.png></p><h2 id=the-virtual-memory>The Virtual Memory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-virtual-memory>#</a></h2><p>The idea of virtual memory is provide an illusion to a program that it is the only program running and it has access to all the memory. The 80286 introduced the foundational concepts of virtual memory to the x86 architecture, though it implemented a more limited form compared to modern processors. Understanding the 80286&rsquo;s approach helps clarify why virtual memory became essential and how it evolved.</p><p>Virtual memory creates an abstraction layer between what programs think they&rsquo;re accessing (virtual addresses) and what actually exists in physical memory. The 80286 achieved this through segmentation-based virtual memory.</p><p><img alt="Virtual Memory" loading=lazy src=/blog/images/virtual-memory-80286.png></p><h3 id=simplified-programming-model-with-virtual-memory>Simplified Programming Model with Virtual Memory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#simplified-programming-model-with-virtual-memory>#</a></h3><p>Before virtual memory, programmer had to directly manage physical addresses which is error prone and there&rsquo;s a possibility of overwriting other program&rsquo;s data. This also means the programmer has to know where the segments will be loaded in memory beforehand. Virtual Memory solves this issue as each segment will be under the illusion that it starts at memory address 0 and can access upto 64KB of memory.</p><h2 id=global-and-local-descriptor-tables-gdt-and-ldt>Global and Local Descriptor Tables (GDT and LDT)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#global-and-local-descriptor-tables-gdt-and-ldt>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-are-descriptor-tables>What Are Descriptor Tables?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-are-descriptor-tables>#</a></h3><p>Think of descriptor tables as address books for the computer&rsquo;s memory system. Just like you use a phone book to look up someone&rsquo;s address when you only know their name, the 80286 processor uses descriptor tables to look up memory information when it only knows a selector (a kind of memory &ldquo;name&rdquo;).</p><h3 id=the-basic-problem-they-solve>The Basic Problem They Solve<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-basic-problem-they-solve>#</a></h3><p>In real mode, programs had to deal with physical memory addresses directly:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Real Mode Problem:

- Programs must know exact physical addresses
- No protection between programs

When P=1, the segment is valid and can be accessed. When P=0, any attempt to access this segment generates a segment-not-present exception, allowing the OS to load the segment from disk (virtual memory support).</li><li><strong>DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level) - Bits 6-5:</strong> Defines the privilege level required to access this segment (0-3, where 0 is most privileged). Code running at privilege level 3 (user mode) cannot access segments with DPL=0 (kernel mode). This enforces memory protection between kernel and user space.</li><li><strong>S (System) - Bit 4:</strong> Distinguishes between application segments and system segments. When S=1, this is an application segment (code/data used by programs). When S=0, this is a system segment (like Task State Segment or LDT descriptor) used by the processor for special operations.</li><li><strong>E (Executable) - Bit 3:</strong> Determines if this segment contains executable code or data. When E=1, this is a code segment that can be executed (instructions fetched from here). When E=0, this is a data segment used for storing variables and cannot be executed.</li><li><strong>D (Direction/Conforming) - Bit 2:</strong> For data segments: D=0 means segment grows upward (normal), D=1 means grows downward (stack). For code segments: D=0 means non-conforming (strict privilege checking), D=1 means conforming (can be called from lower privilege levels without changing CPL).</li><li><strong>R (Read/Write) - Bit 1:</strong> For data segments: R=1 allows write access, R=0 makes it read-only. For code segments: R=1 allows reading the code (useful for debuggers), R=0 makes it execute-only. Code segments are never writable regardless of this bit.</li><li><strong>A (Accessed) - Bit 0:</strong> Automatically set by the CPU whenever the segment is accessed (loaded into a segment register or used). Never cleared by hardware - only software can clear it. Used by operating systems to implement virtual memory algorithms by tracking which segments are actively being used.</li></ul><h3 id=flags-field-4-bits>Flags Field (4 bits)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#flags-field-4-bits>#</a></h3><p><strong>Bit 3: G (Granularity)</strong></p><ul><li><p>G = 0: Limit is in bytes (fine granularity)</p><ul><li>Segment can be 1 byte to 1 MB in size</li><li>Limit value is used directly</li></ul></li><li><p>G = 1: Limit is in 4KB pages (page granularity)</p><ul><li>Segment can be 4KB to 4GB in size</li><li>CPU automatically shifts limit left by 12 bits (multiplies by 4096)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Bit 2: D/B (Default/Big)</strong></p><ul><li><p>For Code Segments: Controls default operand/address size</p><ul><li>D = 0: 16-bit mode (8086/80286 compatible)</li><li>D = 1: 32-bit mode (80386+ native)</li></ul></li><li><p>For Data Segments: Controls stack pointer size</p><ul><li>B = 0: Stack uses SP (16-bit stack pointer)</li><li>B = 1: Stack uses ESP (32-bit stack pointer)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Bit 1: L (Long Mode)</strong></p><ul><li>For 64-bit mode only (not relevant for 80286)</li><li>L = 0: Not a 64-bit code segment</li><li>L = 1: 64-bit code segment (x86-64 mode)</li><li>Rule: If L = 1, then D must = 0</li></ul><p><strong>Bit 0: AVL (Available)</strong></p><ul><li>Available for system software use</li><li>Not used by CPU hardware</li><li>OS can use for its own purposes</li><li>Examples: Process tracking, debugging flags, memory management hints</li></ul><h3 id=global-descriptor-table-gdt>Global Descriptor Table (GDT)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#global-descriptor-table-gdt>#</a></h3><p>The Global Descriptor Table is a system-wide table containing descriptors that all tasks can potentially access.

│ Step 1: Identify Target Task                                │
│ • Extract index from selector 0x0030 → Index 6              │
│ • Look up GDT entry 6 → TSS descriptor                      │
│ • Get TSS base address and verify it&#39;s a valid TSS          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 2: Save Current Task State                             │
│ • Get current TSS address (from TR register)                │
│ • Save all CPU registers to current TSS:                    │
│   - Store AX at TSS+0x12h                                   │
│   - Store CX at TSS+0x14h                                   │
│   - Store DX at TSS+0x16h                                   │

│ Step 3: Mark Tasks                                          │
│ • Set current TSS descriptor busy bit = 0 (available)       │
│ • Set target TSS descriptor busy bit = 1 (busy)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Step 4: Load New Task State                                 │
│ • Load all registers from target TSS:                       │

Before the 80286, programs had unrestricted access to all system resources, meaning a single misbehaving application could crash the entire computer or corrupt critical system data.</p><p>The 80286&rsquo;s ring system solved this by creating four distinct privilege levels (Rings 0-3), arranged in a hierarchical structure where each ring has specific permissions and access rights. Think of it like security clearance levels in a government building - higher clearance (lower ring numbers) grants access to more sensitive areas, while lower clearance (higher ring numbers) restricts what you can access.</p><p>The 80286&rsquo;s ring system introduced hardware-enforced separation between different types of code, ensuring that:</p><ul><li><strong>User applications (Ring 3)</strong> could only access their own resources</li><li><strong>Operating system code (Ring 0</strong>) maintained exclusive control over critical hardware</li><li><strong>Device drivers (Ring 1)</strong> had controlled access to specific hardware components</li><li><strong>System services (Ring 2)</strong> provided a middle layer for specialized operations</li></ul><p><a title="Hertzsprung at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>, via Wikimedia Commons" href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Priv_rings.svg><img width=512 alt="Privilege rings for the x86 architecture, along with their common uses." src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Priv_rings.svg/512px-Priv_rings.svg.png?20250128024610></a></p><p>Modern CPU&rsquo;s removed ring 1 and ring 2 as they are not used by any applications because of complex privilege transitions.</p><h3 id=ring-0-the-kernel-domain>Ring 0: The Kernel Domain<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ring-0-the-kernel-domain>#</a></h3><p>Ring 0 represents the most trusted code in the system - the operating system kernel itself.

Think of it as the &ldquo;postal system&rdquo; of the computer - when the CPU wants to read from or write to a specific location in memory, it sends that location&rsquo;s address through the address bus. Each wire in the address bus represents one bit of the address. The CPU sets each wire to either high voltage (representing binary 1) or low voltage (representing binary 0) to form the complete binary address.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>(Serial Ports) Communication ports for devices like modems, mice, or serial printers. Each COM port has a base I/O address (COM1 typically at 3F8h, COM2 at 2F8h, etc.). The BIOS Data Area stores these addresses so software knows where to find each serial port.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p>(Parallel Ports) &ldquo;Line Printer&rdquo; ports primarily used for parallel printers. LPT1 typically uses I/O address 378h. These were the standard way to connect printers before USB existed. The BIOS stores the base addresses of installed parallel ports.&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p>Whether Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock, Num Lock, or Scroll Lock are currently pressed or toggled. This is stored as bit flags in memory location 0040:0017h.&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5><p>A circular buffer (usually 15-16 characters) that stores keystrokes when they&rsquo;re typed faster than the program can process them. This prevents losing keystrokes during busy periods.&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:6><p>This bitmap, usually set up by the operating system when a task is started, specifies individual ports to which the program should have access. The I/O bitmap is a bit array of port access permissions; if the program has permission to access a port, a &ldquo;0&rdquo; is stored at the corresponding bit index, and if the program does not have permission, a &ldquo;1&rdquo; is stored there. When a program issues an x86 I/O port instruction such as IN or OUT, the hardware will do an I/O privilege level (IOPL) check to see if the program has access to all I/O ports. If the Current Privilege Level (CPL) of the program is numerically greater than the I/O Privilege level (IOPL), the program does not have I/O port access to all ports. If the IOPL check fails, the CPU then consults the I/O bitmap to see if this specific port is allowed. It prevents malicious programs from accessing hardware directly by stopping user programs from interfering with system devices.&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/tags/cpu/>Cpu</a></li><li><a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/tags/x86/>X86</a></li></ul></footer></article><section id=references><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkGZDb3100Q" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Memory in the x86</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4SDPLiUnv4" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">How a Single Bit Inside Your Processor Shields Your Operating System's Integrity</a></li><li><a href=https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">From 0 to 1 MB in DOS</a></li><li><a href=https://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/components/intel/80286/210498-005_80286_and_80287_Programmers_Reference_Manual_1987.pdf target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel 80286 Manual</a></li><li><a href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/readings/i386/s07_01.htm target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Task State Segment</a></li><li><a href=https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/i386.pdf target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel 80386 Manual</a></li><li><a href=https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Descriptor Table</a></li><li><a href=https://wiki.osdev.org/Task_State_Segment target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Task State Segment</a></li></ul></section></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/>Sanketh's Blog</a></span> ·
