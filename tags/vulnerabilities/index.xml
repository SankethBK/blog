&lt;p&gt;A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a fixed-size buffer than it was designed to hold. A buffer is a contiguous block of memory allocated to store data (e.g., an array/string whose length is defined at compile time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about buffer overflows, its almost always about buffer overflows in C programs because of the way the following things are designed in C:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
