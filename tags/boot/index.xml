&lt;p>Previously, we saw that after the BIOS firmware is loaded, it searches for a bootable device from a list of storage options, such as a hard drive, SSD, USB, or network interface. The BIOS identifies a valid bootable device by checking for the &lt;code>0x55AA&lt;/code> signature at the end of the first sector. Once found, it loads the 512 bytes from this sector (LBA 0), which is known as the Master Boot Record (MBR).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What happens when you turn on computer?</title><link>https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/posts/boot/2025-07-02-how-computer-boots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sankethbk.github.io/blog/posts/boot/2025-07-02-how-computer-boots/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-poweron--hardware-reset">1. Power‑On &amp;amp; Hardware Reset&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="1-powergood-signal">1. Power‑Good Signal&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The power supply stabilizes voltages and asserts a “Power‑Good” (PWR_OK) line to the motherboard. All devices receive power and begin to initialize themselves. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is initially held in a reset mode, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s not yet executing instructions. The memory layout is powered up, although the RAM itself has no content since it&amp;rsquo;s volatile.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-cpu-reset-vector">2. CPU Reset Vector&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The reset vector is a predetermined memory address where the CPU begins execution after being powered on or reset. On x86 processors, this address is typically &lt;code>0xFFFFFFF0&lt;/code> (near the top of the 4GB address space). When the CPU comes out of reset, its program counter (instruction pointer) is automatically set to this address. The motherboard&amp;rsquo;s memory mapping ensures that this address points to the BIOS/UEFI firmware ROM chip, so the very first instruction the CPU executes comes from the firmware.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
